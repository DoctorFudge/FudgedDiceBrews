### Tactician
Adepts of the Tactician pursuit have focused their minds on the art and skill of combat. By honing their techniques and studying their enemies, Tacticians become formidable presences on any battlefield.

#### Bonus Profiency
When you choose this pursuit at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.

#### Fighting Style
Also at 2nd level, you adopt a particular fighting style as your specialty. Choose one of the options from those available to the Fighter class. You can't take a fighting style more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
___
- **Archery:** You gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls you make with ranged weapons *(Edit ranged weapons' attacks to add +2 to the attack roll.)*
- **Blind Fighting:** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
- **Defender:** When wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. *(Add effect on this feature, Stats->Armor->Add 1)*
- **Dueling:** When wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. *(Edit melee weapons' attacks to add +2 to the attack roll.)*
- **Great Weapon Fighting:** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a weapon held in two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if it a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
- **Interception:** When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
- **Protection:** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you,you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
- **Superior Technique:** You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. *(Add a feature called "Maneuvers" and add your maneuver.)*
- **Thrown Weapon Fighting** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
- **Two Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second Attack.

#### Force Multiplier
Starting at 5th level, you can spend 3 insight points and use a bonus action to roll a number of insight dice equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) and distribute them as you see fit to your allies. These dice can be consumed as a reaction to make an attack. Attacks made in this way add the number on the die to the attack roll. When combat ends, any unused dice are lost.

#### Improved Study Foe
Beginning at 9th level, the Study Foe feature improves for you in several ways:
- If you are already studying an enemy or your studied foe drops to 0 hit points, you can use a bonus action to begin studying a different foe without spending any insight points.
- You can learn certain information about a studied enemy as if you were using the Field Research feature. Once on each of your turns, you can compare a studied foe and a reference creature of the same type that you have seen, and the DM tells you if the enemy is equal, superior, or inferior to the reference creature in regard to one characteristic of your choice that is listed under the Field Research feature. If you can see the reference creature, you can choose Current HP as the characteristic.
- If your studied foe mimes you with an attack, you gain one insight point. You can only benefit from this feature once per round.

At 18th level, Study For further improves in the following ways:
- You can study more than one for at a time. When using a bonus action to select or change your studied foe, you can spend 2 additional insight points per creature to select additional foes up to a number equal to your Intelligence modifier.
- You have advantage on attacks made against your studied foes.

#### Incisive Strikes
Starting at 13th level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can spend 1 insight point to deal additional damage to the target. Roll an insight die and add it to the damage roll. If you are studying the target with the studied foe feature, roll two insight dice.

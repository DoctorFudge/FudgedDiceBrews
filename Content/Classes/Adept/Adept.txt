## Adept
[**Source:** *Adept*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rlQIJXBwkS-JgtME_mVYvoLVWNLmhd42/view)

A human general clad in gleaming armor studies the map on the table in front of him, filled with figurines that represent units of his soldiers and the invading ores. He consults a leather journal filled with notes he's made on the enemy's tribe, their customs and battle tactics, and he moves two pieces confidently forward.

A wild-haired dwarf stands at the head of a long caravan. She surveys the valley below and plots their course through the untamed wilds. She sketches a map and motions for the caravan to follow, leading them deeper into unknown territory in search of treasure and knowledge.

Kneeling at the side of a fallen comrade, a gnome hastily applies a tincture and bandage. Her ally's eyes flutter open and she helps him back to his feet before turning her attention to a nearby troll. An elaborate twirl of her quarterstaff befuddles her foe, and a sharp, unseen blow to the back of its head leaves it stunned.

A smirk pulls at the comer of the half-elf's mouth as he surveys the overgrown ruins on the hilltop. Though no doubt filled with traps and dangerous beasts, the promise of lost treasure and forgotten knowledge pulls him onward. No trinket or secret, no matter how old, could evade his thorough investigation.

### Experts in the Ordinary
Where many scholars and academics dedicate their great minds to unraveling the mysteries of the divine or the arcane, adepts focus their intellectual efforts on the mundane, the physical world around them and all the wonders it holds.

This curiosity manifest in different ways, Some adepts am most interested in the workings of the body, learning how every part serves the whole so that they can better understand and heal it. Others become life-long students of the art of war, devising ways to dominate the battlefield with superior tactics rather than superior brawn. And some are more concerned with the world itself, keen to seek out every corner of every min, to commune with foreign peoples, and discover exotic beasts and the wild lands that hold them.

### Worldy Scholars
For the truly curious, the adventuring life is the only way to expand ones horizons of knowledge and build ones skills. Any adept worth his salt will quickly agree that books and laboratories make excellent avenues for learning, but no book and no beaker contains the knowledge still waiting to be discovered beyond the frontier or in the crucible of battle.

The adept believes that every scholar reaches a point where the most effective path to higher learning is hands on experience. The world is full of discoveries waiting to be made.

### Creating an Adept
As you create your adept character, consider your motivation for becoming a scholar of the world as opposed to a student of the so-called higher mysteries. Did you grow up hearing tales of explorers charting the unknown? Perhaps a skilled healer managed to cure a family member of a terrible disease when the local priest could not? Were youraised the child of great warriors and lacked the brawn to follow in their footsteps, but had the brains to make up the difference?

Where did your path to learning begin? Did you have a brilliant mentor who passed along his knowledge? Did you sneak into the royal library to pore over thick tomes recounting ancient history? Maybe you became a student at a prestigious university devoted to expanding knowledge of all kinds?

What prompted you to leave your old life behind and become an adventurer? Are you have trouble adjusting after a life in academia? Or do you finally feel a sense of freedom? What kind of knowledge are you hoping to discover in your travels?

Some combat insight features will have you roll an insight die. The type of die you use is determined by your adept level as shown in the Insight Die column of the Adept table.

Some of your combat insight features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

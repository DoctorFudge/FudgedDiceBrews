### Coven of the Gibbous Moon
Fate is written in both the stars and blood, for those who look with careful eye. Witches of the Coven of the Gibbous Moon consider themselves to be the arbiters of destiny, reading fate and either averting it or ensuring its completion. These indigo witches also act as spirit guides, bringing the souls of the dead to their final place of rest through rite and ritual. Witches in this coven are often neutral, respecting the forces of death and fate in the broader cosmos, and knowing their place as but a servant to each.

#### Gibbous Moon Spells
You gain advanced tutelage into specific spells important to your coven. You learn each of the spells on the following list at the witch level associated with them. These spells count as witch spells for you and do not count against the total spells you can know.

##### Gibbous Moon Spells
| Witch Level | Spells |
|:-:|:--|
| 2nd | <em>chaos bolt\*, guiding bolt</em> |
| 3rd | <em>augury, gentle repose</em> |
| 5th | <em>speak with dead, spirit guardians</em> |
| 7th | <em>divination, Mordenkainen’s faithful hound</em> |
| 9th | <em>scrying, Rary’s telepathic bond</em> |

\* this spell is found in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything

#### Read the Entrails
When you join this coven at 2nd level, you learn how to read the secret signs hidden in a creature’s viscera. When a creature that is not an undead, elemental, ooze, or construct is reduced to 0 hit points and dies within 10 feet of you or your familiar, you can use a reaction to read fate in the substance of its death.

If you do, roll twice on the Revelations table, selecting one of these two results and then choosing a creature within 30 feet of you. That creature gains the effect you selected, which lasts until its stated duration or until you take a short or long rest, whichever is first.

Once you use this ability, you require a short or long rest before you can use it again.

##### Revelations
| d10 | Revelation |
|:-:|:-|
| 1 | **Inspiring Insight.** The chosen creature gains a point of inspiration. |
| 2 | **Fortuitous.** The creature has advantage on the next saving throw it makes. |
| 3 | **Narrow Escape.** The selected creature can immediately move a distance up to its movement speed, which does not provoke opportunity attacks. |
| 4 | **Turning Point.** The creature has advantage on the next attack it makes. |
| 5 | **Downfall.** The creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes. |
| 6 | **Deficiency.** The creature has disadvantage on the next attack it makes. |
| 7 | **Weakness.** The creature becomes vulnerable to a damage type of your choice, until it takes damage of that type once. |
| 8 | **Hidden Might.** The creature’s next attack that hits deals an extra 1d8 damage. |
| 9 | **Forgotten Curio.** The creature finds a new mundane item of your choice on its person, which is worth 5 gp or less. |
| 10 | **Fatesight.** The creature is aware of the exact location of all other creatures within 30 feet of it until the beginning of your next turn, including creatures that are invisible or in the Ethereal plane. |

#### Psychopomp
At 6th level, when you summon your familiar, you can have it manifest as a spectral version of itself. While in this form, your familiar gains the following additional benefits:
A flying speed of 30 feet with the hover property (unless it has a faster flying speed)
The ability to become invisible until the end of its next turn by using an action
The ability to pass through solid surfaces other than those made of lead. If your familiar ends its turn within a surface, it takes 2d10 force damage, which cannot be reduced or ignored, and is expelled to the nearest available location.
Resistance to all damage other than psychic; radiant; and bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage from magical or silvered weapons

Additionally, when your familiar shares a space with a creature, you can cause your familiar to use its reaction to share one of these benefits of your choice with that creature. The creature receives the chosen benefit until the beginning of your next turn. Once you share a benefit in this way, you cannot do so again until you have finished a short or long rest.

#### Fortune Telling
At 10th level, you know the secrets to true fortune telling. As a 10-minute ritual, you conjure a tarokka deck and tell the fortune of a willing creature besides yourself within 5 feet of you for the duration of the ritual.

This creature must share a language with you, and must have a CR or level of at least 1 to have a destiny significant enough for this reading. Roll three times on the Fortune Telling table, or, if you have a physical tarokka deck, shuffle together the high deck with the masters of swords, stars, coins, and glyphs, and deal out three cards.

The creature must then select one of these cards, which it keeps. If the card is not specified to be used immediately, the creature can use the card with no action on its turn. The card’s magic fades once 24 hours have passed after the completion of the ritual, so it must be used within that time. A creature cannot have its fortune read by this ritual more than once every 30 days.

When a creature is selecting a card, it is to know nothing about the fortune it chooses other than the name of the card and its appearance. Any hints as to the nature of the fortune bestowed by a card (by either any character or any player) invalidate the ritual, causing the spell slot to be expended with no result. Once the creature has selected a card, however, it knows fully the effects of the card chosen.

A creature cannot receive the same fortune twice. If you draw a card that the creature has previously chosen, reroll it or discard it and draw again. If it is impossible to draw three cards without turning up one which the creature has already selected, this ritual no longer works for that creature.

Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again until you have completed a long rest.

Starting at 14th level, when you use your Read the Entrails feature, you can roll 3 times on the Revelation table, still selecting only one result. You can use your Read the Entrails feature twice between rests.

In addition, while using your Psychopomp feature, your familiar can share two of the feature’s benefits instead of one with a single creature.

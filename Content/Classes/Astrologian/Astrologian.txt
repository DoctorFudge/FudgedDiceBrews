# Astrologian
##### Masters of astromancy and altering fate, astrologians divine the truth that lies within the heavens. These scholars not only look to the stars but track their movements as well. By attuning their aetherial energies to that of constellations, they weave magic in a unique manner. Wielding a star globe and a divining deck, fortune always seems to follow these mages of the stars.

### Creating an Astrologian
As you create an astrologian, ask yourself how your character views destiny and fate. Do they believe them to be redundant, or do they have separate meanings? Are our lives all predetermined, or can you fight against these celestial forces?

Once you've chosen your views on the matter, consider how your astrologian acts on these beliefs. How have these beliefs served you so far? Are they what brought you to learning astromancy, or was that just the life forced upon you? What are your ultimate goals? Did you start adventuring to spread your esoteric knowledge, or did you simply tire of being cooped up in the observatorium?

#### Quick Build
You can make an astrologian quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Wisdom your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose the sage background. Third, choose the *guidance*, *light*, *sacred flame*, and *true strike* cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells *bless* and *cure wounds*.

### Spellcasting
By attuning your aether to the movement of the celestial bodies, you can cast spells to take control of fate. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of the class entry for the astrologian spell list.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the astrologian spell list. You learn additional astrologian cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Astrologian table.

#### Spell Slots
The Astrologian table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your astrologian spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these astrologian spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *cure wounds* using either slot.

#### Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the astrologian spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Astrologian table shows when you learn more astrologian spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the astrologian spells you know and replace it with another spell from the astrologian spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your astrologian spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an astrologian spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: center">
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
</div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast an astrologian spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you know the spell.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a star globe as a spellcasting focus for your astrologian spells.

### Major Arcana
At 1st level, you can read your or an ally's fortune, granting one of various benefits. As a bonus action, you summon a magical Deck of Sixty and draw a major arcana card from it. Roll a d6 to determine which card you draw using the Major Arcana Overview table. Once drawn, you may place the effect of the card on yourself or an ally within 30 feet as a reaction. The effect lasts for 1 round. You may only hold on to one card at a time. An unused card will disappear after a long rest.

Your major arcana feature improves at 8th and 15th level. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. The following describes the major arcana and their effects.

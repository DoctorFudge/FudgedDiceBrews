### Spirit of Divinity
Similar to Death Lanterns, Divine Lanterns are created when Nightbreakers with particularly strong qualities undergo the bonding ritual with their lantern. Wielders of Divine Lanterns are often justice-seekers, defenders of the weak, or simply have a strong sense of altruism. Wielders of Divine Lanterns are a force to be reckoned with.

To this end, these lanterns bless the wielder with a number of spells themed around protection and enhancing the combat abilities of both the Nightbreaker and their party.

**Lantern Power:** At level 2, when one of your allies within 30 feet that you can see makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to give them a bonus equal to your wisdom modifier. You can use this after they roll, but must do so before the result of the roll is determined. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your wisdom modifier.

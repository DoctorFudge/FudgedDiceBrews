### The Sweet Science
Pugilists who practice the Sweet Science hit hard, fast, and often. This style is sometimes used by fighters who battle for the entertainment of the upper classes, but is just as often practiced in the back alleys and the bars by those whose next breath depends on a knockout.

#### Cross Counter
Starting when you choose this fight club at 3rd level, you can block the brunt of an attack and launch one of your own in the same fluid motion. You can use your reaction and spend 2 moxie points to reduce the damage of a melee weapon attack made against you by 1d10 + your Strength modifier + your pugilist level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can make an unarmed strike, or pugilist weapon attack, against a creature within range as part of the same reaction.

#### One, Two, Three, Floor
At 6th level, when you use your bonus action to use the Old One-Two and hit the same creature with both attacks, you can spend 1 moxie to make an additional unarmed strike against that creature as part of the same bonus action. If you hit, the creature is knocked prone in addition to taking damage as normal for your unarmed strike.

#### Float Like a Butterfly, Sting Like a Bee
At 11th level, when you reduce damage from an attack to 0 and successfully hit an enemy creature using your Cross Counter feature you regain 1 moxie point (up to your maximum).

#### Knock Out
At 17th level, when you hit with an unarmed strike or pugilist weapon, you can spend 1 or more moxie points to try to knock out the opponent instead of dealing damage. Roll 3d12 + 2d12 for every moxie point spent after the first and add your pugilist level to the result; if the total is equal to or greater than the creature's remaining hit points, it is unconscious for 10 minutes.

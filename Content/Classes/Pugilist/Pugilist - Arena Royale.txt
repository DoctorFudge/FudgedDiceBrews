### Arena Royale
Pugilists in the Arena Royale fight club travel the world earning their keep as equal parts performer and gladiator. Whether performing in staged physical competitions, or fighting it out in unscripted brawls, pugilists in the Arena Royale care as much about the theatrics of a fight as they do its outcome. Pugilists in this fight club also care deeply about their reputation and work to build up local and regional legends about their performing personas.

#### Bonus Proficiency
Starting when you choose this Fight Club at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Performance skill, if you don't have it already. If you do, you gain proficiency in your choice of the Intimidation or Persuasion skill.

#### Persona Libre
Also at 3rd level, you create an alternate persona that you can adopt or discard as a bonus action on your turn. When you create an alternate persona you should give the persona a striking name as well as some physical signifier (such as a mask, colorful cape, or another prominent idiosyncratic feature). Unless you tell a creature, or the creature sees you adopt your persona, they do not know you and the adopted persona are the same person.

Additionally, you have a pool of persona points equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). When you use an ability that costs moxie points, you can spend persona points instead. In addition, before you make a Charisma ability check you can spend a persona point to add your Strength modifier to the result. You can only use persona points while you have adopted your persona. You regain all expended persona points when you finish a long rest.

#### Work the Crowd
At 6th level, while you have adopted your alternate persona, you can use your action to inspire your choice of fear or adoration in those nearby. When you do, all creatures within 30 feet who can see you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be charmed, if you chose adoration, or frightened if you chose fear. This effect lasts for one minute. Each time a creature takes damage from you or one of your allies it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. You can use this feature again after you finish a long rest.

#### High Flyer
Starting at 11th level, your base movement increases by 10 feet, your jump distance is doubled, and you can use a bonus action on your turn to take the Dash action.

#### Signature Move
Starting at 17th level, you create a signature move that you can use while you have adopted your alternate persona. Give your signature move a name and a description. You can replace one of your unarmed attacks or attacks with a pugilist weapon on your turn with this signature move.

When you use your signature move, you can jump in any direction up to your movement speed, make an attack roll with advantage against a creature in your reach and, if you hit, the attack is a critical and the creature is stunned until the end of your next turn.

If you hit with your signature move, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again. If you miss with your signature move, you regain the use of it after 1 minute.

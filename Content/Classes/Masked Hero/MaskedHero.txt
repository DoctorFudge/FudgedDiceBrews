## Masked Hero
[**Source:** *The Masked Hero*](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-Ldcap7uXXpVI3mA_sC7/-LeWDAGIzzhd52xpDKoT)

The orc slashes its axe across the archer's abdomen, causing her to drop to her knees in pain. When the warrior swings its weapon again to deal the killing blow, a figure appears before them in the blink of an eye, and deflects the attack with one sword strike. The bleeding archer gasps, before gazing up in awe at the helmeted, violet warrior that now stands over her.

Uttering a command-phrase, a red suit of armor begins to manifest around the mysterious stranger. As the armor-pieces join together in perfect harmony, an audible melody rings in the air, as if heralding the arrival of a saviour. When the tune finally ends, the crimson knight unsheathes a flaming blade.

Driving the entire length of the blue blade straight into the orc's torso, the gigantic beast cries out in pain before the masked figure sends it reeling backwards with a blazing kick. Right as the monster's back hit the wall behind it, its howl of pain is silenced by a burning fist that caves-in its skull. The beast finally dead, its body crumbles away as ash in the wind.

Beyond the safe haven of cities, masked heroes endlessly battle against the forces of evil. Donning suits of armor fueled by their force-of-will, these warriors take up heroic personas to fight as the world's faceless defenders. They fight for those who can't, and do so even if their efforts are unrecognized.

### Faceless Warriors of Self-Sacrifice
Donning colorful uniforms and masks, a masked hero is a selfless warrior that jumps straight into combat without any hesitation. Wielding  weapons and a variety of spells to assist their companions on the battlefield, their abilities shine at their brightest when these masked warriors are standing side-by-side alongside other daring adventurers.

But it is during the critical moment when an ally is about to be struck where a masked hero shows their true potential. In mere seconds, a masked hero can appear in front of allies to absorb - if not deflect - blows that would kill lesser beings. It is through sheer willpower that they do not die to their wounds, as they fight, so others do not have to suffer.

No matter where the battlefield may be, these heroes never hesitate to appear. As they take to the fields of battle in their masked forms, their mere presence is enough to bolster any warriors that find themselves fighting alongside these faceless avengers. Whenever a person is in need of help, the arrival of a masked hero is only seconds away.

### The Persona Beneath the Mask
The defining aspects of a masked hero are the mask and uniform that they don, both channeling innate abilities while also enforcing the unforgettable image of a faceless vigilante of justice.

While not in this form, a masked hero looks like any other person that you would find in the crowd. But whenever the time for battle comes, a masked hero rushes right into the forefront, mystical armor and weapons manifesting into view with no more than a single command to call them forth.

It is with this form that a masked hero strikes fear into the hearts of their enemies, as it is hard to forget the appearance of the enigmatic warrior that is capable of decimating several opponents with ease.

### Creating a Masked Hero

When creating a masked hero, you must first decide how your character acquired the powers that they wield. Were they gifted to you from mysterious individuals? Perhaps you found a mysterious device buried within an ancient crypt? Are these powers something that you had desired, or was it a matter of taking up a mantle that had been passed onto you?

Even though the concept of a masked hero may seem like it calls for those of both pure mind and body, you need only an unwavering force-of-will, and the ability to turn that will into a weapon, in order to hone your abilities. The reason why you are able to do this can vary, whether it is because you fight for the sake of people that you care about, or  because you had been given some sort of mysterious purpose alongside your newfound powers.

#### Quick Build

You can make a masked hero quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom, and Constitution. Second, choose the folk hero background.

### Heroic Armaments
As an action, you can transform a weapon that are you are wielding - and proficient in - into a tool of justice called a heroic armament. After you do so, harmless visual effects, such as floating musical notes or blue flames, can be perceived around your weapon. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest, and ends early if you die.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). Whenever you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

### Masked Transformation
On your turn, you can transform as a bonus action to assume your heroic form and gain the following benefits:

- Your Armor Class equals 13 + your Wisdom modifier. While transformed, wielding a shield doesn't increase your Armor Class. Any armor that you are wearing also merges into your heroic form, and has no effect until the end of your transformation.
- You can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls of any weapon attack you make with your heroic armament.
- Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 force damage to a creature you hit with a melee weapon attack if there is at least one friendly creature within 10 feet of that creature.

Your transformation lasts for a number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one hour), and ends early if you are reduced to 0 hit points or die. You can also end your transformation as a bonus action on your turn.

Your masked hero level determines the number of times you can transform, as shown in the Transformations column of the Masked Hero table. You recover all expended uses of Masked Transformation when you finish a short or long rest.

### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you
later get to choose again.

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### Spellcasting
Starting at 2nd level, you can summon a magical item called a bonded device. This device is a unique tool that is capable of channeling the power within you into the material realm in the shape of spells. See the end of the class description for the masked hero spell list.

> ##### Your Bonded Device
> The spells that you cast are all channeled through the focal point that is your bonded device. With this magical tool, you can shape the energy within you to  bolster both your allies - and yourself - in the heat of battle with a variety of spells.
>
> ***Summoning a Device.*** To summon a bonded device - or replace one you've lost - you can perform a special 1-hour ritual over the course of a short rest to summon a bonded device.
>
> This process costs 30 gp, which  represents the raw materials that you require in order to construct the device's physical form. At the end of the ritual, your bonded device appears at your feet.
>
> ***The Device's Appearance.*** How your bonded device appears upon summoning can range from the mundane to the extravagant. It could be in the shape of a  belt with various trinkets inserted into it, a colourful arm-brace with several magical symbols and icons, or even an intricate, colourful wand with arcane runes engraved into it. How it looks is based completely on what you desire upon summoning it.

#### Bonded Device
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the masked hero spell list at the end of the class description. These spells, as well as every other masked hero spell that you can learn later on, can only be cast while your bonded device is on your person.

If your bonded device remains more than 5 feet away from you for more than 1 minute - or if you die - it disappears, and would need to be replaced by another bonded device.

The Spells Known column of the Masked Hero table shows when you learn more spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with another spell from the masked hero spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spell Slots
The masked hero table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these masked hero spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *healing word* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *healing word* using either slot.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your masked hero spells, as your ability to attune to the raw energy within you is what shapes your spells into a variety of effects. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a masked hero spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<center>

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
Wisdom modifier

</center>

<center>

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your
Wisdom modifier

</center>

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use your bonded device as a spellcasting focus for your masked hero spells. To use a bonded device in this way, it must be held in hand, worn visibly, or borne on a shield.

> ##### A Hero to One, Villain to Another
> Despite the popular image of a heroic defender of justice, one does not have to be of good or even neutral alignment to be a masked hero.
>
> A masked hero is simply a steadfast warrior that is determined to protect any ally on the battlefield, their unwavering will driving them to defeat those that stand in the way of their ideals and goals.
>
> Regardless of one's beliefs, a masked hero's powers is fueled purely by the unbreakable spirit within them, granting  abilities unlike any other.

### Deflective Strike
Starting at 2nd level, you can intercept attacks meant for your allies. Once per round, when a friendly creature that you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of that creature to make one special melee weapon attack.

You can only make this attack with either a melee weapon or an unarmed strike, and you make this special attack before the triggering attack deals any damage.

This special attack also deals no damage, but if your attack roll is equal to - or higher - than the opposing attack roll, the triggering attack is deflected, and neither of the attacks deal any damage.

Otherwise, the triggering attack instantly deals damage to you instead of the friendly creature, and the damage you take is reduced by an amount equal to 5 + half your masked hero level (rounded up). You can use this feature as long as you aren't frightened or incapacitated.

After using this feature, you may only attack once, instead of twice, when you take the Attack action on your next turn. If you are able to attack three times, instead of twice, whenever you take the Attack action, you may only attack twice instead.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). Whenever you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

At 3rd level, you can use Deflective Strike when you are hit by an attack. When you use Deflective Strike this way, you do not teleport.

### Heroic Decree
At 3rd level, you dedicate yourself to a decree that represents your idea of justice, while also granting you new abilities as a result of your unwavering faith. You may choose the Decree of Retribution, the Decree of Preservation, the Decree of Salvation, the Decree of Conviction, or the Decree of Execution, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Triumphant Armaments
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack with your heroic armament twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Steadfast Resolve
Starting at 5th level, your attunement with your heroic vitality allows you to regain bits of your fighting strength in the most dire of situations. Whenever you finish a short rest, you can recover a number of Deflective Strike's expended uses equal to half your Wisdom modifier (rounded down).

### Enhanced Transformation
Starting at 6th level, your transformed state has achieved its next tier of power. Choose one of the following options to add onto your Masked Transformation's benefits:

***Banner of Victory.*** You generate an aura that extends 5 feet from you in every direction - but not through total cover - while transformed. Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn within this aura, it takes force damage equal to your proficiency bonus. In addition, when a friendly creature that you can see within 15 feet of you deals damage to an enemy creature with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus to the damage dealt by that attack equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one).

***Heroic Seals.*** You learn three cantrips: *guidance* and two other cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. These cantrips count as masked hero spells for you, and they don't count against the number of masked hero spells you know. In addition,  you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 30 feet.

***Providence Mantle.*** While transformed, wielding a shield increases your Armor Class. In addition, whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with a shield that you are wielding. This attack counts as an attack made with a heroic armament. The damage die for this attack
is a d4, and the attack deals force damage.

***Rending Gauntlets.*** Any weapon attack you make with a heroic armament ignores all resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. In addition, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, and that creature has damaged you since the end of your last turn, you can deal extra force damage equal to your proficiency bonus. You can deal this damage only once per turn.

***Vitality Plating.*** Whenever you transform, you gain temporary hit points equal to 4 + your proficiency bonus. These temporary hit points last until they are depleted, or until the end of your transformation. In addition, you can add an extra d4 to any Constitution saving throw that you make to maintain concentration on a spell.

At 14th level, and again at 18th level, you can choose one additional Enhanced Transformation option. You cannot take the same  option more than once.

### Limit-Break
At 10th level, you can go beyond the limits of your abilities to attain superhuman strength and agility, causing your body to break apart as you momentarily push your transformed state to the peak of its potential.

Whenever you use Masked Transformation, you can choose to take damage equal to your character level at the same time. Afterwards, you can attack with your heroic armament three times, instead of twice, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, and your speed increases by 15 feet.

This superhuman state lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if you are reduced to 0 hit points, or die. Afterwards, at the start of your next turn, your transformed state ends early, and you suffer one level of exhaustion.

### Zenith Armaments
At 20th level, you can use an action to elevate a heroic armament that are you are wielding into its ultimate form, granting your armament the following properties:
- Any attack roll you make with the heroic armament is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
- Any creature damaged by the heroic armament has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't made against you until the end of its next turn.
- Once on each of your turns, when your heroic armament is more than 5 feet away from you, you can command it to return to your open hand.

A zenith armament lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if you die. Afterwards, your zenith armament reverts back into a heroic armament, and you require a long rest before you can use this feature again.

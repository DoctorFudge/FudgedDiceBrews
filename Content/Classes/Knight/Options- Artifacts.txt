## Relics of Adventure
If a Relic has prerequisites (listed in italics), you must meet them in order to obtain it. You can obtain any Relic at the same time as meeting its requirement. You may choose to exchange Relics during a long rest but lost any bonus incurred by their affects as a result.

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for Relics. If a Relic requires an attack to be made, the attack bonus is calculated as follows:

<center>

**Relic Attack Bonus** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

You may only use one Relic per round but may receive the benefit of multiple Relics at once unless otherwise noted.

### Path of the Brave
Few nobles possess the courage and selflessness to walk the Path of the Brave. Those who do often won their rank through deeds of valor, or are descended from someone who did.

When you first choose the Path of the Brave you gain the following features:

#### Bonus Proficiencies
You gain proficiency with martial weapons, heavy armor, and shields.

#### Resilient Leader
Your hit point maximum increases by 2, and you gain 2 additional hit points whenever you gain a noble level.

#### Dauntless
Starting at 2nd level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that would cause you to become frightened.

#### Fighting Style
At 6th level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You canâ€™t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

**Archery:** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

**Defense:** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

**Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

**Great Weapon Fighting:** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

**Protection:** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

**Two-Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two- weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

#### Extra Attack
Starting 11th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Overwhelming Blow
At 14th level, you learn to focus all of your heroic strength into a single blow. When you declare an Overwhelming Blow, make a single weapon attack against a creature you can see as an action. If this attack hits, the target must make a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a failure, the target is knocked prone and stunned until the end of your next turn. This feature may be used three times, and uses are regained after a short or long rest. If your Overwhelming Blow misses, it still counts against your three uses of this feature.

#### Lionheart
Beginning at 17th level, you cannot be frightened and allies who can see or hear you have advantage on saving throws made to resist becoming frightened.

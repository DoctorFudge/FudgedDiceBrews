A dwarf covered in dirt looks down in annoyance as he stitches up an arm after an avoidable mining accident, his supplies for the day already running low.

Sliding a razor—sharp blade along the serpent's back an elf expertly severs its spinal cord, slaying the creature While preserving its body for harvesting toxins.

The sharp claws of a dragonbom swipe downward, removing the infected limb of a fellow adventurer before the poison can spread, a burning torch already prepared to cauterize the wound

Doctors are the healers of the common man, working tirelessly in places the gods have overlooked Though they lack the magical abilities of other healers their results are no less effective. Whether it's saving a life or ending a life, a doctor utilizes their hard-earned knowledge to achieve their goals; no matter What they are.

### Knowledge is Power
Doctors aren't born, they are made. It takes years of study and practice to gain the skills required to be a competent healer, and even then, there is always more to learn. Everything from long lost scrolls to dusty tomes might hold a new secret to preserving life, and it is their responsibility to discover it. It isn't uncommon for a doctor to spend their down time seeking out the nearest library, only to be dragged away days later by the party in order to move on with their adventure.

### Hard Earned Healing
Unlike many who can heal simply by calling on the powers that be, Doctors must make do With intelligence, skill, and hard work. Not only that, but healing Without magic is far less convenient. Every sedative and healing salve a doctor uses was hand crafted by them. They spend most evenings boiling bandages and refilling syringes, all While trying to get the blood out of their clothes. It can be a hard life, but luckily a doctors skills are always in high demand.

### Creating a Doctor
When making a doctor your first thoughts should be towards your practice. Did you own your own clinic Where injured townspeople gathered? Perhaps you sold experimental potions out of your bag to travelers in need along on the road? Or maybe you spent your days in the back of a tavern, stitching up the wounds of thieves and cutthroats Who paid well for your discretion.

Have you become an adventurer by choice, seeking to protect those Who put their lives on the line for the greater good? Or were you run out of town for selling oro blood as healing potions, and found yourself With other outcasts? Regardless, wherever you go a healer is almost always welcome.

#### Quick Build

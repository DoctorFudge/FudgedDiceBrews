#### Servant of Flesh
At 18th level you have reached the apex of the medical profession and have found a way to create life rather than just preserve it. You now have the ability to create a Flesh Golem from the bodies of the recently deceased. To do this you must operate on a body that has been deceased no longer than 24 hours before the beginning of the procedure. The operation takes an additional 12 hours that cannot be interrupted, otherwise it fails and the body is destroyed.

The golem appears as a normal living humanoid and requires a perception check DC17 to determine its true nature. The golem cannot talk but understands you and follows your instructions. Due to the amount of time and energy needed to create and maintain golerns you can never have more than two at one time. Ask your DM for the creature's stats.

### Combat Medic
Preventing damage can be just as useful as repairing it, and no one understands this better than the combat medic. They aren't meant to be stuck in a clinic, they do their best work when on the battlefield. While still an expert healer they focus just as much on how to hurt as how to heal.

#### Adrenaline Shot

These effects are physical rather than magical and cannot be dispelled Only your body can benefit from this ability due to your years of experiments. You may use this feature once per long rest.

#### Pretty Make-Up
After taking this specialisation at 2nd level, while wearing your make-up, you know *friends* and *guidance*. This doesn't count against the number of cantrips you know.

#### Just Can't Resist
Starting when you take this specialisation at 2nd level, you become proficient in Persuasion if you aren't already.

While you are wearing make-up, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability checks you make using Persuasion.

#### Favoured Face Option: White as Snow
At 3rd level, this option becomes available to you. You can communicate simple ideas with tiny beasts such as birds, squirrels, and fish through sounds and gestures.

#### Charming Magic
Starting at 6th level, when a creature fails a saving throw against one of your spells of 1st level or higher, the creature is also charmed by you for the duration of the spell if you choose.

#### Boundless Charm
Starting at 13th level, when you make an ability check using Persuasion, you can replace any result on the die with a 10.

#### External Beauty
Also at 13th level, you can spend 1 hour to apply make-up to an allied creature you can see. Once the make-up has been applied, while the target wears this make-up, it shares your Boundless Charm feature.

#### Irresistible
Starting at 20th level, enemies have disadvantage on saving throws against your enchantment spells of 1st level or higher.

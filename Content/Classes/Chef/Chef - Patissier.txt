### Patissier
Chefs who favor desserts are called Patissiers. These eccentric individuals often have a reactionary mind, making decisions based on the situation at hand. Patissiers have an answer for everything, complimenting each action with a sweet finish.

#### Special Recipes: Desserts
Meals created from a Dessert Recipe are not consumed as a bonus action. Instead, they are consumed as a reaction to certain events occuring.

#### Cake Munitions
At 7th level, Your surplus ingredients can be made into projectiles. You can hurl special ammunition with your ladle. These special types of ammunition do not deal damage to the target on a hit, instead applying an effect as described below:

***Flour Bomb:*** Until the end of its next turn, attack rolls against the target have advantage, and the target loses any benefits from being invisible.

***Rotten Egg:*** the target is poisoned until the end of it's next turn.

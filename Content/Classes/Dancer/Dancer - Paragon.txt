### Paragon
You've devoted your training to dance as an art form itself, staying a purist of dance. Your singular focus will allow you to reach mastery few ever hope to achieve in your discipline.

#### Inspiring Salsa
Beginning at the 3rd level, as a bonus action you can spend up to 2 Dazzling Dance charges to inspire an ally within 5ft. of you. Your ally may add a bonus to any attack roll, saving throw or ability check they make equal to twice the number of charges used to inspire them one time. At 10th level you may spend any number of Dazzling Dance charges in the same way.

#### Magic of Movement
Beginning at the 6th level, when you cast a spell, you may spend a number of Dazzling Dance charges equal to the spell level instead of spending a spell slot. Spells cast using this feature do not generate Dazzling Dance charges.

#### Improvised Flow
Beginning at the 11th level, when you make a concentration check you may spend a Dazzling Dance charge to roll with advantage.

#### Forte Fusion
Beginning at the 15th level, you have learned how to mix known dances into new exciting combinations. You are able to cast a second spell which requires concentration without ending the first. To do so you use your action to spend 1 Dazzling Dance charge to cast the second spell alongside the required spell slot. Each turn you concentrate on the second spell, you must use your action to spend once Dazzling Dance charge and spend 10ft. of movement per spell.

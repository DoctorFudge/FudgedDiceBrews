## Dragoon
[**Source:** *Final Fantasy XIV Class Compendium*](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LsDqsNbupzeLhkTIcPv)

An Elezen man stands before a fierce dragon, it roars out and begins to take off in order to gain the advantage. With a massive leap the man lands atop the dragon and forces it back to the ground, creating an opening for his allies.

A Hyur cloaked in scale mail whirl's their spear around a cluster of enemies keeping them at bay. When the time is right they unleash a plume of fiery breath from beneath their helm, singing their targets.

A Viera woman runs and leaps high into the sky, magical wings forming on her body. With grace, she travels the currents of the wind, happily flying about as she exercises her new found freedom.

These fearless warriors stand against dragons, demons, fiends and any other threats who would raise a hand against their homelands. Dragoons use their command of both the sky and ground to strike down their foes with deadly strikes.

### Dragonbane
The Dragoon was a soldier born out of need in a distant land. Their homeland has been locked in a war against dragon kind for hundreds of years, leading to their soldiers to specialize in battling back against dragons. Their most notable ability is the Dragoon Jump, which is powered by a magical gem each Dragoon receives upon completing their basic training.

### Masters of the Sky
The Dragoons have been blessed with the ability to soar high into the air like those they have taken up arms to destroy. These warriors are able to crash down from the sky using their weapons and body weight to drive any skyborn into the ground, or cause great damage to those already on land. Wings will not grant you safety from a Dragoon.

### Creating a Dragoon
When creating a Dragoon, consider what brought them down the path of a specialized knight. They may have shown a certain aptitude which allowed them to become a dragoon with ease, or perhaps were born into the role due to the history of their homeland. A dragoon may have decided upon this path due to the stories of famed dragoons of legends, hoping to become as powerful and respected as the knights they had heard about while they were growing up. You must consider as well how the Dragoon came to possess the blessed gem in their possession granting them their jumping prowess.

Consider why a Dragoon would choose to head out on an adventure. Are they seeking a specific dragon, hoping to slay an enemy of their nation? Could your dragoon have unfinished business with a dragon from their past? Sometimes a dragoon may set out for the sake of journeying around the land.

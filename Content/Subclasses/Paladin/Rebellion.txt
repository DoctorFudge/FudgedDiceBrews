### Oath of Rebellion
[**Source:** *The Complete Devout Handbook*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TEY7P4FVWD_-Ky5YrrK92__yYOwTY3w-/view)

The Oath of Rebellion is a righteous commitment to stamp out all tyranny, to uphold the ideals of liberty and free will. Sometimes called torchbearers, mob knights, or riot knights, paladins who swear this oath are champions of the common man, and scourges of all those who would oppress them. They believe that, if it is in the name of ending a dictator's rule, they can engage in any deception, treachery, and violence, proclaiming that freedom for all is worth any stain on their soul.

#### Tenets of Rebellion
Though specific tenets of the Oath of Rebellion can vary by paladin, the basic intents are the same. Due to the flagrant disregard for societal law and the demand for self-sacrifice in these tenets, most paladins of the Oath of Rebellion are chaotic good in alignment.

***Suffer no Tyranny.*** I recognize tyranny in all its forms, and tolerate none of it. Dictatorship, hypocrisy, and corruption all must be expunged.

***Ignite the Fire.*** No single ember can burn a castle to the ground, but many embers combine to create an inferno powerful enough to raze any fortress. I inspire the oppressed to join me in the fight for their freedom.

***Never Back Down.*** No matter my own personal suffering or tragedy, I continue forward. I refuse to be struck down without accomplishing my mission.

***Ends Justify Means.*** I will engage in murder, deceit, and treachery if it means that innocents can be free. I eat these sins in the name of liberty.

#### Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

##### Oath of Rebellion Spells
| Paladin Level | Spells |
| :-: | :-- |
| 3rd | <em>disguise self, heroism</em> |
| 5th | <em>enhance ability, pass without trace</em> |
| 9th | <em>mass healing word, nondetection</em> |

#### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity Options.

***Incite Rebellion.*** As an action, you ignite a fire in creatures surrounding you, using your Channel Divinity. Choose any number of other creatures within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you; each target gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Until a target loses all of its temporary hit points, it is immune to being frightened, and you have advantage on Charisma checks you make to incite it to action against a tyrant, oppressive state, or similar circumstance.

***Unbreakable Spirit.*** When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to bolster that creature, using your Channel Divinity. The creature is instead reduced to 1 hit point. It then gains temporary hit points equal to your paladin level, and can rise to its feet if it was prone.

#### Aura of Tenacity
Starting at 7th level, when you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you starts its turn with no more than half its hit points left, it gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

#### Vive la RÃ©sistance
Beginning at 15th level, when a creature other than you within 30 feet that you can see takes damage, you can use your reaction and expend hit points from your Lay on Hands pool to prevent some or all of the damage. When you do, you prevent an amount of damage equal to the number of hit points you spent from the pool. If you spend 10 or more hit points from the pool this way, the creature can use its reaction to make a weapon attack.

#### Avatar of Rebellion
At 20th level, as an action, you can become a conduit for the outrage of oppressed peoples throughout the multiverse, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You can't be grappled, incapacitated, or restrained, nor can you have your movement reduced in any way, other than by becoming unconscious due to having 0 hit points. If you are subject to one or more of these conditions when you use this feature, the condition immediately ends on you.
- Once, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can choose to be reduced to 1 hit point instead. You regain the use of this ability at the start of your next turn.
- When a creature casts a spell or uses an ability that would frighten or charm you or one of your allies within 30 feet of you, you gain advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Your innate magic comes from a powerful concentration of elemental water. Some such sorcerers may have been revived from a near drowning, or been otherwise affected by contact with the Plane of Water. Perhaps an ancestor of theirs forged a pact with a powerful denizen of the deep, and that ancient magic has resurged in the present generation. The mysteries of the deep cling to the very blood of such a sorcerer.

#### Aquatic Affinity
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your tie to the sea grants you increased mobility. You gain a swim speed equal to your walking speed, and can breath under water. You can also cast spells with verbal components while submerged.

Additionally, your affinity for water gives you the option to learn some non-sorcerer spells that focus on controlling water. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can select the spell from the following list, in addition to the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.

| Spell Level | Spell |
| :-: | :-- |
| 1st | <em>Absorb Elements</em> |
| 1st | <em>Create or Destroy Water</em> |
| 3rd | <em>Tidal Wave</em> |
| 3rd | <em>Wall of Water</em> |
| 4th | <em>Control Water</em> |
| 5th | <em>Maelstrom</em> |

#### Lunar Pull
Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the moisture in the world around you. You can summon or dismiss up to a cubic foot of water at a time, and have Shape Water as a cantrip in addition to your normal sorcerer cantrips.

Additionally, currents form where you may go. When you are in water at least two feet deep, as an action you may use your concentration to make ripples flow 10 feet out from you in a moderately strong current. That area becomes difficult terrain for other creatures. The currents may be dismissed as a bonus action.

#### Tide Born
At 6th level, the ocean's spray clings to you. You gain the ability to ignore any of the drawbacks caused by a deep, underwater environment. You gain resistance to cold and poison damage. At level 18, these resistances become immunities.

Beginning at 6th level, the power of currents is drawn to you even upon land. You can spend 2 sorcery points to create a flow of water that circles around you for 1 minute or until your concentration ends, making the area within 10 feet of you difficult terrain. A reaction may be used to force a creature passing through that area to make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

#### Sound of the Depths
At 14th level, you develop strange and alien senses of the depths. You have tremorsense for a range of 30 feet. In water, this range becomes 60 feet.

#### Vengeful Currents
Beginning at 18th level, you learn to employ the deadlier powers of water. As a reaction to an attack, you can expend 2 sorcery points to extend a tendril of water toward the attacker if they are within 60 feet, you can sense them, and they are a Medium or smaller creature. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw or become grappled for 1 minute. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and unable to breath unless it can breath water. If a target succeeds on their saving throw, the tendril of water collapses. You may also end the grapple as a bonus action. This feature may only target one creature at a time.

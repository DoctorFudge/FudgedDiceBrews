You can use your action to create a number of pieces of firearm ammunition equal to 10 + your Charisma modifier in your empty hand. When loaded into your firearm, these bullets count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. These pact bullets disappear if they are 5 or more feet away from you for at least 1 round, or 1 hour after you create them. You may use this feature once, and regain the ability to use it after a long rest.

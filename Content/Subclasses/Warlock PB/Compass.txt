Your patron has allowed you to hold the Black Compass, an instrument of guidance and tool for divining your master's will. The compass does not point towards magnetic north as other compasses do, instead it bends in the direction that your patron desires.

While you possess the compass, you can make navigation checks on the open water as though you were trained and you do not risk getting lost if you lose sight of 1and.Additiona11y, you can Whisper the name of one person known to you and the needle of the compass Will point in their direction for the next 24 hours. You must finish a long rest before using this ability again.

At 11th level, you can cast *find the path* using the compass as the required divinatory tool once per day Without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can cast this spell again. At the discretion of your DM, there is always the possibility that your patron is manipulating your compass to draw you into the web of its greater schemes.

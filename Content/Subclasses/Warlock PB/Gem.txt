#### Pact of the Gem
[**Source:** *Praise Be The Goodberry! Compendium*](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LZeyRZtzKZLu2cjiglX)

Your patron grants you a mystical jewel. You can use this jewel as a spellcasting focus. Additionally, your warlock spell save DC increases by 1.

If you lose your Gem, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous gem. The gem shatters when you die.

[**Source:** *Praise Be The Goodberry! Compendium*](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LZeyRZtzKZLu2cjiglX)

Your patron grants you a durable quarterstaff. You can use this staff as a spellcasting focus. You are considered proficient with this staff. Additionally, you learn the Shillelagh cantrip. This does not count against you number of cantrips known.

If you lose your staff, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous staff. The staff turns to ash when you die.

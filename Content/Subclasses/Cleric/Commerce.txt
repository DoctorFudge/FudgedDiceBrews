### Commerce Domain
[**Source:** *The Complete Devout Handbook*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TEY7P4FVWD_-Ky5YrrK92__yYOwTY3w-/view)

The Commerce domain values trade, proper management of resources, and entrepreneurship above all else, believing a healthy economy is the best path to create a more perfect world. Gods of commerce and trade – including Gond, Kol Korran, and Waukeen – promote enterprise and the development of marketable crafts and skills. Some clerics of this domain, however, eschew the worship of gods to instead focus their faith on the almighty coin, believing that wealth is the best resource for enacting lasting change and living long, happy, and healthy lives.

Regardless of what gods, or lack thereof, clerics of this domain worship, they are always on the hunt for the best deal, and travel the planes marketing their talents as healers and appraisers. In larger cities, temples of Commerce are often found offering a variety of services: from the standard spellcasting services of healing and revival, to the exchange of goods and coin, to the selling of magical tinctures, to high-risk venture capitalist groups in which others can invest their money.

#### Blessings of Commerce
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the mending cantrip if you don't already know it, and you can use a money pouch or coin purse as a holy symbol.

#### Instant Gratification
Also starting at 1st level, you can bypass the lengthy process of haggling for mundane items and wealth by converting goods to coins and vice versa. As an action, you can use this feature for one of the following effects:
- You magically transform a nonmagical object you're touching into its monetary worth in coins. For example, a mundane longsword you transform this way becomes 15 gp.
- You magically transform a number of coins you're touching into a nonmagical object worth an amount equal to or less than the net value of the coins you transform. For example, you can transform 2 or more cp into an ink pen, or at least 1,500 gp into a set of plate mail.

This feature has no effect on objects or coins belonging to an unwilling creature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Irrefusable Offer
Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to bribe a creature into changing the way it attacks. When a hostile creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack against you or one of your allies, you can use your reaction to cause 5 gp to appear at the creature's feet. If the creature can see the gold, it changes the target of the attack to another target of your choice within range of the attack, other than itself. If there are no other valid targets within range, the creature loses the attack.

This feature has no effect on creatures that are immune to the charmed condition, or that place no value in gold or money, such as creatures of Intelligence 4 or lower.

#### Liquid Assets
Once you reach 6th level, whenever you cast a spell requiring a specific material component with an indicated cost, you can expend a number of coins you possess with net worth equal to half the indicated cost, instead of presenting the component.

#### Potent Spellcasting
Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

#### Adventure Capitalist
Beginning at 17th level, you can use your Instant Gratification an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, as an action, you can magically transform a number of coins you're touching into a potion you've tasted worth an amount equal to or less than the net worth of the coins you transform. You use the minimum values in the Magic Item Rarity table in Chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine how much a potion of a given rarity is worth. For example, you can transform 101 or more gp into a potion of uncommon rarity, such as a *potion of greater healing*.

This feature has no effect on objects or coins belonging to an unwilling creature.

The number of existing potions you created with this feature cannot exceed your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). If you create a potion beyond this number, another potion of your choice that you created this way expires and becomes inert.

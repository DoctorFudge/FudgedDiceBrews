[**Source:** *Faerie Fire*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dW4MQWnzS74jMR3TBn-hXX50Oy6La39e/view)

Practitioners of apostate magic in the Wilds often find themselves at a disadvantage when engaging with members of the Monarch's court, where the Living Light is strictly outlawed; however, not every fey can detect the signs of the Living Light's magic, and some of its adherents can walk throughout the Wilds unmolested, provided they keep their (admittedly glowing) hand close to their chest.

Warlocks with a Living Light patron have been chosen as vessels of order, though the intelligence that defines that order is alien and inscrutable.

#### Expanded Spell List
The Living Light lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

#### Living Light Channel
At 1st level, you can ignite your connection to the Living Light as a bonus action. For 1 minute your damage with weapon attacks becomes radiant damage and all your radiant or force damage against objects is maximized. Once you use this feature you must complete a short or a long rest before you use it again. At 10th level, once per turn when you hit with a weapon attack you deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage.

#### Light Dice
At 1st level, you gain a number of d6s equal to your warlock level divided by 3, rounded up (see table at left). These are your Light Dice. You can expend these dice to gain several dierent benets:
- You can expend and roll a Light Die to generate a dazzling display of lights. You can add the result of the roll to a Charisma (Performance) check or a Wisdom (Perception) check if such a display would benet it. If the display would benefit a different type of skill check, your GM may choose to allow it.
- You can expend a Light Die to increase the radius and light level of a light source within 60 feet. Dim light becomes bright light and the radius of the light doubles for 1 hour.
- When you deal radiant or force damage to a creature, you can expend and roll one Light Die, adding the result to the damage for that creature. At 10th level you can expend and roll 2 dice.
- When you deal radiant or force damage to a creature, you can expend 2 Light Dice to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your Warlock spell save DC or be blinded repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success.

You regain your Light Dice on the completion of a short or long rest. for 1 minute on a failure. e target can

#### Trick of the Light
Starting at 6th level, you've learned to channel the Living Light to power your illusions. When you cast an illusion spell that does no damage and does not apply a condition to another creature, you can make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you regain the expended spell slot.

Each time you use this feature after the rest, the DC increases by 2. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 12.

#### Light Walk
Starting at 10th level, you gain resistance to radiant damage. In addition, as an action you can become Living Light. Until the end of your turn your movement becomes 100 feet, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity from movement, and you are able to pass through creatures. You leave a stream of light behind you as you move and you are unable to re-enter any space you have already been in this turn. Any creature you pass through or touch during this turn takes radiant damage equal to your Charisma modier.

Once you have moved a total of 100 feet or dealt damage to 10 creatures this way, the eect ends. If you end this eect in a space you cannot occupy, you are shunted to the nearest available space. Once you use this feature you must complete a long rest before you use it again.

#### Light Command
At 14th level, *prismatic spray* counts as a warlock spell for you and may be selected as your Mystic Arcanum. Additionally, you can cast *prismatic spray* once per long rest without expending your 7th-level Mystic Arcanum. When cast in this way you can choose a number of affected targets equal to your Charisma modfier. Instead of rolling you can choose which color of ray affects them, choosing from results 1-7. Once you have used this feature you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

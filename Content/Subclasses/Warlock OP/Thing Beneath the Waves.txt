You have forged a pact with some inscrutable creature that dwells in the eternally lightless depths far beneath the surface of some notable body of water. This creature's ambitions are often inscrutable, due to the inhospitable environs in which they dwell. Many look to see kingdoms brought 10w beneath the waves, or for the world to be consumed in unending floods. Others have goals more nuanced and all the more dreadful.

Entities of this type include Zothâ€”Ommog and the Abolethic Sovereignty. Some exceptionally powerful sea creatures like the kraken or leviathan may also be able to grant such power through pacts with mortals.

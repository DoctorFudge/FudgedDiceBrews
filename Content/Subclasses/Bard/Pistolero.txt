[**Source:** *The Gunpowder Codex*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jjhLL1aeWVp2AsoOIwJJ-0BvO6dvPedk/view)

Although most bards tell tales of heroes wielding more traditional swords, some prefer to sing ballads about dashing gunslingers, and some even take the time to master the art themselves. These bards are known as pistoleros, simultaneous masters of the arcane, song, and one-handed firearms. Stylish and skillful, these bards are eager to display their fancy moves.

#### Proficiency
Starting when you choose this bardic college at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one-handed firearms, allowing you to add your proficiency bonus to attacks made with one-handed firearms.

#### Gunsmith
Upon choosing this bardic college at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Tinker's Tools. You may use them to craft ammunition, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM's discretion). Some extremely intricate and experimental firearms are only available through crafting.

#### Pistolero's Panache
At 3rd level, you supremely deft in handling your guns. When you use the Attack action on your turn and attack with a one- handed firearm, you may attempt one of the following tricks.

***Dodger's Panache.*** Your experience as a traveling pistolero has made you more adept at staying out of harm's way. As a bonus action, spend one use of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and applying the number rolled as a bonus to your next Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw.

***Gun Flourish.*** You spin your firearm around in a brilliant display of dexterity. As a bonus action, you expend one use of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and applying the number rolled as a bonus to one Charisma ability check made within the next minute. If you do not make a Charisma ability check within a minute, the inspiration is wasted.

***Trigger Panache.*** Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and apply the number rolled as a bonus to the next ranged attack roll you make with a one-handed firearm this turn. If the target of the attack is an unattended, inanimate object, the bonus equals double the die roll.

#### Extra Attack
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Graze
Beginning at 14th level, you have mastered marksmanship with one-handed firearms. When you miss an attack using a one-handed firearm, you graze your target and still deal a small amount of damage equal to your Dexterity modifier. A critical failure still results in a complete miss, and no damage is done. You may use this feature only once per turn.

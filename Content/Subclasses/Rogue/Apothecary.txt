[**Source:** *The Complete Martialist Handbook*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oGWtJWYIL63dUACooColfDVhX6MllXji/view)

You have trained in the science of chemistry and learned to make a variety of concoctions that heal and harm. You may specialize in cruel poisons and admixtures that debilitate your enemy, restoratives and drugs that empower your allies, or dabble in both. Apothecaries often learn their craft under a mentor or at an academic institution, but it's also possible to learn this science through books and experimentation.

#### Chemist
Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in alchemist's supplies, herbalism kits, and poisoner's kits if you don't already have them. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses any of those proficiencies.

#### Craft Concoction
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to craft poisons, tinctures, and admixtures from materials you have on hand.

***Concoctions.*** You learn three concoctions of your choice, which are detailed under “Concoctions” below. You learn two additional concoctions of your choice at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Each time you learn new concoctions, you can also replace one concoction you know with a different one.

***Doses.*** You can spend 1-minute crafting a dose of concoction you know with materials you have on hand. You can create up to 3 doses per day and regain all your expended doses when you finish a long rest. All concoctions become inert and have no effect after 24 hours. You can create an additional dose per long rest when you reach 9th (4 doses), 13th (5 doses), and 17th level (6 doses).

***Saving Throws.*** Creatures immune to poison are immune to the effects of your concoctions. Some of your concoctions require a creature to make a saving throw to resist the concoction's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follow:

**Concoction save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

#### Biochemical Lore
Starting at 9th level, when you are within 30 feet of a creature you can see, you know if they have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to poison.

#### Preventative Measures
Starting at 13th level, you have resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.

#### Cocktail Crafter
Starting at 17th level, when you finish a long rest, choose one concoction you know. You make a number of doses of that concoction equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). These do not count against the doses you can make until your next long rest.

#### Concoctions
The following concoctions are presented in alphabetical order: Black Tear Powder. You can blow a dose of this powder into the eyes of a creature within 5 feet with the Use an Object action. When you do, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for one minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the blinded effect on a success.

***Blisterskin Oil.*** You can throw a dose of this oil onto a creature within 5 feet with the Use an Object action. The creature takes 1d8 acid damage and an additional 1d8 acid damage at the start of each of its turns for the next minute. The creature can end this effect by using an action to clean the oil from itself.

***Bitterbite Toxin.*** You can apply a dose of this toxin to a weapon with the Use an Object action. The next time this weapon deals damage, it deals extra poison damage. This extra damage is equal to your Sneak Attack damage. This destroys the dose of toxin. A weapon can only benefit from one dose of bitterbite toxin at a time.

***Charming Philter.*** You can apply a dose of this philter to yourself or a target creature within 5 feet that you can see with the Use an Object action. For the next hour, when a creature that must breathe enters a space within 15 feet of the target it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the target for the remainder of the duration of the philter. This effect automatically ends if the creature takes damage from the target or one of the target's allies and cannot affect the creature again for 24 hours.

***Flashfreeze Powder.*** You can blow a dose of this powder towards a creature within 5 feet with the Use an Object action. When you do, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take cold damage and have its movement speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn. This cold damage is equal to your Sneak Attack damage. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, it takes half damage and its speed is unaffected.

***Haste Tar.*** A creature can apply a dose of this tar to their gums with the Use an Object action. When it does, for the next minute the creature adds half your proficiency bonus to its AC and can take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, or Disengage action as a bonus action on its turn. After that minute, the creature gains a level of exhaustion.

***Mule Mix.*** A creature can pinch a dose of this mix into its mouth with the Use an Object action. When it does, it has advantage on Strength saving throws, it deals an additional 1d6 damage when it makes weapon attacks that add Strength to hit, and it is considered one size larger for determining carrying capacity and the weight it can push, pull, or lift. These effects end after one hour, at which time the creature gains a level of exhaustion.

***Nervewrecker Toxin.*** You can apply a dose of this toxin to a weapon with the Use an Object action. The next time this weapon deals damage to a creature, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned and take 1d10 poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success.

***Restorative Tonic.*** A creature can consume a dose of this tonic with the Use an Object action. When a creature drinks this tonic, roll your Sneak Attack damage dice. The creature regains hit points equal to the result.

***Revenant's Resolve.*** A creature can consume a dose of this mixture with the Use an Object action. When it does, roll your Sneak Attack damage dice. The creature gains temporary hit points equal to the result, and for the next minute ignores the effect of any levels of exhaustion it has. After that minute, the creature gains a level of exhaustion.

***Stonesleep Tincture.*** A willing creature can consume a dose of this tincture with the Use an Object action. When it does, the creature can choose to fall asleep on its turn anytime within the next minute. If it does, the creature is petrified for 8 hours. When this effect ends after 8 hours, the creature gains all the benefits of having finished a long rest and loses an additional level of exhaustion.

***Sleeping Syrup.*** A creature can apply a dose of this syrup to a weapon, food, or drink with the Use an Object action. A creature that consumes the food or drink or who takes damage from that weapon must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion. A creature that fails that saving throw must succeed on another Constitution saving throw after one minute has passed or become unconscious for 8 hours. When a creature uses its action to rouse the sleeping creature or the sleeping creature takes damage, the sleeping creature may make another Constitution saving throw, waking up on a success.

***Smelling Salts.*** A creature can take the Use an Object action to administer a dose of these salts to itself or another creature within 5 feet of it. When it does, the creature affected can choose to wake up or end one effect causing it to be charmed, frightened, or stunned.

***Tangle Root Toxin.*** You can apply a dose of this toxin to a weapon with the Use an Object action. The next time this weapon deals damage, the creature is inebriated for the next minute. While inebriated, it has disadvantage on Perception ability checks and the first time each turn it uses its movement, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and have its movement speed reduced to 0 until the end of its turn.

***Waking Nightmare Acid.*** You can apply a dose of this acid to a weapon with the Use an Object action. The next time this weapon deals damage, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails, it is frightened and takes 1d6 psychic damage at the start of each of its turns for the next minute. The creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

***Universal Antidote.*** A creature can drink a dose of this antidote with the Use an Object action. When it does, all poisons and non-magical diseases currently afflicting the creature immediately end. Additionally, for the next minute, the creature has resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against poison.

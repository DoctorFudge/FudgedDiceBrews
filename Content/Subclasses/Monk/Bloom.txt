#### Ki Blossoms
Monks of the Way of the Bloom are masters of creating auras with their life force and ki. Immense focus and meditation is required of these monks to learn to harness ki in a way to bolster others.  At 3rd level, you learn the ki blossoms that are signature to the Way of the Bloom, which require ki to use.

You learn two ki blossoms of your choice, as detailed in the ki blossoms sections below. You learn two additional ki blossoms of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

Whenever you learn a new ki blossom, you can also replace one ki blossom that you already know with another blossom.

Blossoms are always centered on yourself, and will follow you as you move. You are assumed to also be under the effect of an active blossom unless a blossom specifically states otherwise. The radius of the blossom is 10 feet, but spending an additional ki point can increase the radius by 5 feet. At 3rd level you can only spend 1 ki point to increase the radius, but this goes up to a maximum of 2 at 6th level, 3 at 11th level, and 4 at 17th level.

Some blossoms may require a saving throw. The DC for this saving throw is **8+your Proficiency Bonus+your Wisdom Modifier**.

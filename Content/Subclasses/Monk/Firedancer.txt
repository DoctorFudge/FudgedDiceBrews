While many who use firearms do so merely for power, to make an impression, or for tactical reasons, monks known as firedancers have turned the use of small guns into an art form. Gracefully dancing between opponents, firing at close range and deflecting enemy attacks, firedancers are whirlwinds on the battlefield.

#### Proficiencies
Starting when you choose this monastic tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one-handed firearms, allowing you to add your proficiency bonus to attacks made with one-handed firearms. Additionally, one-handed firearms count as monk weapons for you. You also gain proficiency in the Acrobatics skill, if you are not already proficient in it.

#### Gunsmith
Upon choosing this monastic tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Tinker's Tools. You may use them to craft ammunition, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM's discretion). Some extremely intricate and experimental firearms are only available through crafting.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
Also at 3rd level, when you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

#### Point Blank
Beginning at 3rd level, making a ranged attack roll while within 5 feet of an enemy doesn't impose disadvantage on your roll. Additionally, if you make an attack with a one-handed firearm and no creature other than your target is within 5 feet of you, you may spend a ki point to gain advantage on the attack roll. You may use this ability only once per round.

#### One with the Gun
At 6th level, you extend your ki into your one-handed firearms, granting you the following benefits.

Magic Guns. Your attacks with your one-handed firearms count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

Precise Strike. When you hit a target with a one-handed firearm, you can spend 1 ki point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

#### Firedancer's Parry
Beginning at 11th level, you have learned to anticipate the movements of enemies who use ranged weapons and disrupt their aim. Whenever an enemy that you can see within 15 feet of you makes a ranged weapon attack against you or an ally, you may use your reaction and spend 1 ki point to make a flying leap. You may move up to 15 feet in this leap, and when landing you impact your target enough to impose disadvantage on their ranged attack roll.

#### Firedancer's Reload
At 17th level, you can reload your guns with preternatural grace and speed. By spending 1 ki point as a free action on your turn, you can make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to reload one piece of ammunition into any one-handed firearm you are holding. You may load one additional piece of ammunition into each gun for every 5 that you exceed the DC (2 bullets at 15, 3 at 20, et cetera).

While some wizards have a natural talent for magic, studying and honing their skills for years, others have a proclivity for messing it all up. Wizards of this caliber are often expelled from their academies and forced on the streets, becoming no more than cheap magicians. While many resign themselves to this fate, others choose to fight it and continue their studies on the road. Though the humble dropout may seem underwhelming at best and incompetent at worst, a bit of well placed luck when it matters most can make them an asset worth having.

#### Parlor Tricks
Starting when you select this tradition at 2nd level, you learn the cantrip Prestidigitation. If you already know Prestidigitation you can instead choose another cantrip from the wizard spell list. You add your Intelligence modifier to Performance and Slight of Hand checks involving cantrips.

#### Hightail It!
At 2nd level, as a bonus action if a hostile creature is within 10 feet of you, your cowardly nature allows you to move up to your full movement away from it without triggering attacks of opportunity. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all uses on a long rest.

#### Magical Mishaps
At 2nd level, your magical talent shifts between bouts of brilliant genius and infuriating incompetence. Whenever you cast a wizard spell of 1st level or higher with a casting time of one action or less, roll a d20. On a 1 you fumble the spell, making it backfire and causing an additional negative effect based on the school of magic listed in the Magical Mishaps table. On a 20 the spell is instead cast with extra fervor and a dash of luck generating an additional flourish. If the mishap has a lingering effect and is generated from a spell with concentration it will last until concentration is broken. Effects that require saving throws use your spell save DC. Creatures make subsequent saving throws at the start of each of their turns.

#### Aura of Malfunction
At 6th level your poor magical luck spreads to other creatures and objects around you, Whenever a creature you can see casts a spell within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to force them to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a fail a fumble from the magical mishaps table activates for them. Alternatively you can target a potion or magic item as a bonus action making them unstable. For potions roll a d4 each round. On a 1, or if the potion is destroyed, the potion explodes dealing 2d8 acid damage + 1d10 fire damage to each creature within a 10 foot radius centered on the potion. For magic items, any time the item is triggered it deals 2d10 lightning damage to the user. A creature can use its action to stabalize a targeted object. You can do this a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier and regain all uses on a long rest.

#### Study and Cram
Beginning at 10th level, after each long rest you can choose a school of magic to put extra effort and focus into. Whenever you cast a spell from this school you treat a 19 as a flourish as well as a 20, and can intentionally trigger a mishap of your choice from this school once per day. Additionally your years of cramming information allows you to have an additional two spells prepared from this school. You can prepare an additional spell at 15th and 20th level.

#### Master of Misfortune
At 14th level, if you're knocked unconscious or killed you can use your reaction to cast a spell of 5th level or lower. If the spell requires concentration it's effects instead linger for the full duration but summoned creatures and effects with actions or movement act on their own will, being hostile to any creature other than yourself that enters within 20 feet of you. Spells with an area of effect are cast centered on yourself. After using this ability you must finish a long rest before doing so again.

The first ever Thrro was created to be a gift to a noble king's daughter. Seeing the resilience of the golem in safeguarding his daughter from minor accidents about the castle walls, the King had requested the mages make more with the means to defend their kingdom. The mages took this request as a challenge, a chance to improve their creation's weaknesses to not only abide to a noble's request, but to also strengthen their defenses. In a year's time, the king was visited by an army of red garbed golems, musket in hand and purpose in mind. Fight not for conquest, but to protect their new found home.

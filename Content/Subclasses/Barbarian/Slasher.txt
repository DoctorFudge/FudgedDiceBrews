### Path of the Slasher
The destructive instinct: fighting, torturing, killing, experiences buried deep within our hearts, waiting for the slightest provocation to be unleashed. At first glance the endless bloodshed seems to be an act to satisfy some destructive instinct, but beyond the horror, the shedding of blood and the very real appearance of death puts us in touch with life.

#### Blood Bath
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, your unrelenting bloodlust empowers your attacks. While you're raging, the first time you attack a creature if you have advantage, and the attack connects, it takes an additional 1d6 necrotic damage, and begins to bleed. 

A creature that is bleeding takes 1d4 Necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. At the end of each of their turns a creature can make a Constitution saving throw to end the effect, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

#### Quietus
Also at 3rd level, you learn to channel your rage into a razor-edged desire to kill. While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- You have advantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks
- You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured, such as by by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, or mist.
- Your footsteps make no sound regardless of the material you are walking on.
- Using your action to hide will also prolong your rage.

#### No Escape
Starting at 6th level, the thrill of the kill compels you to leave no survivors. While you are hidden, as a bonus action you can move to any position within your walking speed of you that no creatures have line of sight to but you could otherwise reach. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.

At 12th level, this range increases to any distance within 15 feet of a creature who is Bleeding or Frightened of you.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Terrifying Presence
At 10th level, you learn to make a signature sound which inspires unspeakable dread in your enemies. As a bonus action, you unleash a nightmarish battle cry. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Creatures that cannot see you and creatures with the Bleeding condition have disadvantage on this saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature's speed is reduced by half, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Sometimes They Come Back
Beginning at 14th level, you become an implacable menace to your foes, which allows you to shrug off fatal blows.

While you're raging, having 0 hit points doesn’t knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don’t die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.

Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

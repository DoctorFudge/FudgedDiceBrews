[**Source:** *The Complete Martialist Handbook*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oGWtJWYIL63dUACooColfDVhX6MllXji/view)

You belong to an ancient line of barbarians who practice sacred hunts and rituals to adopt the shape of beasts. When you begin this path, you incorporate elements of the beasts you have hunted into your physical form when you rage. As you continue on the path, you learn to slip from your skin to that of a beast and grow to the size of nature's fiercest predator's when you rage.

#### Sacred Hunt
When you choose this path at 3rd level, you learn a sacred hunting ritual that allows you to gain the abilities of beasts. With 1 hour of heavy activity, you can perform this ritual, choosing a natural weapon and your choice of two of the following benefits. Once the ritual is completed, you gain that natural weapon and those benefits while raging. When you perform this ritual again, you lose all benefits selected from your previous use of this feature.

***Natural Weapon.*** You grow horns, tusks, sharpened teeth, or claws. When you make an unarmed attack, you can choose to use this natural weapon to deal 1d8 damage. If you use horns, tusks, or sharpened teeth this damage is piercing, if you use claws this damage is slashing.

***Climber.*** You have a climbing speed equal to your base walking speed.

***Darkvision.*** You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

***Gills.*** You can breathe in both air and water and have a swimming speed equal to your base walking speed.

***Stride.*** Your base walking speed increases by 10 feet.

***Venomous.*** When you deal damage with your natural weapons, you deal an additional 1d4 poison damage.

## Level 2

#### Cold Snap
*Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 ft (5 ft radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous.
- **Classes:** Sorcerer, Wizard
___
A swirling burst of freeze wind erupts at a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. 

The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Heat Swell
*Transmutation*

- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes:** Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer
___
The air in a 10-foot tall, 15-foot radius cylinder centered on a point within 5 feet of the ground becomes dangerously hot and humid. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 fire damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the air is subtle, and difficult to see. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the area as hazardous before entering it.

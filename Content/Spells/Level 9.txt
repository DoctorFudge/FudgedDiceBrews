If the target is an ally they regain 100 hit points and gain 100 temporary hit points.

If the target is an enemy, they must a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save they take 7d10 bludgeoning damage and are restrained for the duration, and if they succeed they only take half damage and are still restrained.

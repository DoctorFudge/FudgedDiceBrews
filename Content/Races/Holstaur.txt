While they've been subject to a wide-range of nicknames, some less flattering than others, the formal name of the species of sapient, humanoid creatures resembling bovine quadrupeds is Holstaurus. This is, however, merely the name kept in official records in most cities and settlements under the question of race. Truthfully, the Holstauri themselves believe that there are actually two different races: The Kerani, or "True Blood" and the Kaori, or "Distant Blood".

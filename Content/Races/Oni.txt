___
Oni are a race of rugged mountain dwellers, distantly related to Trolls and Ogres, with either one or two horns. However, they differ starkly from their cousins. While still large, strong, and often brutish, Oni are known for possessing powerful magic and being far smarter. They are large and fearsome, standing taller than the tallest man, and often wear loincloths made of the pelts of great beasts.

### Revelers on the Mountains
All oni possess extreme strength and constitution, and many of them are also accomplished sorcerers. They are ferocious warriors, and live high on mountain peeks where they train and make merry in great endless festivals.

### Noble Demons
While not actually related to the denizens of Hell or the Abyss, an Oni's huge horned figure makes for a common misconception. Despite this, Oni are honorable, and despise liars. They easily settle in to the life of adventure in pursuit of strong foes and stronger drink.

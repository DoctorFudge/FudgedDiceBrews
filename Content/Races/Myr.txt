— Memnarch, Master of Mirrodin
</div>
  
Aeons ago in a world most adventurers would never set foot in, the Myr were created by the wizard Memnarch, Ruler of Mirrodin. Originally, the Myr were created as mindless servitors and act out a single role without question, each one purpose built for their task. It is said that the Myr came in as many different shapes as men, and no two were designed alike.
  
However, the centuries past and one day their master vanished. Since the fall of Memnarch, many Myr continued to fulfill their duties regardless of having no master while others simply shut down to await commands that would never come. Some developed a consciousness and free will, traveling the planes in search of their master, or perhaps a new purpose.

### A Thousand Hands, For a Thousand Tasks
The Myr are bipedal constructs, with small sullen eyes and crested, beak-like faces. Their dexterous hands have only four fingers, and their hunched backs belay their spry nature.
  
Each Myr is an individual, its body shape and composition chosen carefully by their master to suit their destined task. After his disappearance however, some took to changing themselves to adapt to the rigors of adventuring life.
  
### Purpose Built
A Myrs place in the world is perhaps their most defining trait, dictating their height, strength, tools, and even their metallic skin. Each aspect intended to provide some benefit and make them the master of their task. The common unawoken Myr is content to simply perform its duties and watch the other inhabitants of the world. 
  
Those who have taken up the mantle of adventurer however, usually lack such finesse of design, often with more varied and general builds. They seek their own purpose, yearning for the structure and schedule of their brethren.

### Myr Society    
Myr are not typically social creatures unless by design. Among the Myr, all are equal under their creator. Even still, there exist some Myr who exist to monitor others to their tasks, known as Enforcers. Each Myr considers the other family, especially those of similar function. 

Myr have a unique way of sharing information between one other. The Myrmind is a hivemind network akin to that of an insect, allowing any Myr to attune to the thoughts of another and wordlessly transmit data. These messages are seemingly specially encoded, as even skilled mindreaders have difficulty understanding them.

### The Pursuit of Purpose
The Myr changed without their master. Suddenly their countless tasks had no purpose behind them. The Myr worked the engines of Mirrodin, shaped the land and hunted the enemies of an absent king. As the Myr are defined by their work, their hollow tasks sparked them to new try and find new purpose.
  
Many set out across the planes, seeking new tasks and new masters. Others intended to seek out Memnarch and return him to the throne of Mirrodin. Others still, wander without purpose, seeking a meaning to their newfound freedom. A Myr adventurer may be of any model, but the purpose behind its tools is of their own making.
  
### Myr Names
Those among the Myr who take names often base them after their own purpose. Alternatively, they may simply address themselves as a model number. As constructs they do not follow a gendered name structure like other humanoids.

**Myr Names:** Adapter, Coretapper, Galvanizer, Landshaper, Propogator, Retriever, Servitor.

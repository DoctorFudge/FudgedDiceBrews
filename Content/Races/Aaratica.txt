### Adventurers on the Wing
Aaratica are diminutive cousins to the aaracockra, but rather than resemble raptors or other birds of prey, they resemble other types of birds. Most aaratica fear or revere their larger brethren, and will take caution to avoid them should they encounter them in the skies. Aaratica vary wildly, but most often live in areas where others of their kind are plentiful, or might migrate with their family, tribe or clan. In addition to flight, some are capable swimmers, and others eschew flight altogether, preferring the brisk waters of the open ocean.

Haan-hii resemble ducks, geese, pelicans, boobies or other waterfowl. They have a reputation for both passion and formality, and do not suffer fools gladly.

A flock might include up to three dozen members of an extended family of haan-hi.

#### Paar-Dal
Par-Dal resemble cockatoos, sparrows, robins, canaries, nightingales, or other birds with especially bright plumage and loud voices. They tend to be braggarts, and perhaps even a bit selfish, and have developed a reputation for being superficial gossips and chatterboxes.

Many paar-dal are master craftsmen, and they dedicate a great deal of time and energy to the quality and finery of their home, collecting objects of great beauty to arrange and keep on display.

Almost all paar-dal families spend countless hours singing, dancing and teaching their children to sing, and it is considered a great shame among them to not be able to sing well and have a wide repertoire of traditional songs. Others extend this love of music and learn to play a musical instrument to supplement their musical prowess.

[**Source:** *Skinwalker*](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/M56U750sk)

Most people believe skinwalkers are half-breeds of lycanthropes, or that they share some slight version of the curse of those creatures. Skinwalker shamans say they are chosen by nature or the gods to be a bridge between the world of humanity and the animal world. The truth may lie somewhere between these two ideas. For indeed, skinwalkers are those with a lycanthrope crouching somewhere in the branches of their family tree. These distant progeny of monstrous werewolves and other creatures of the night have special talents unlike those of most civilized peoples, and they arise randomly among remote humanoid populations as well as within their own secretive sects. A pair of humans may give birth to a skinwalker—the dormant lycanthropic ancestry making itself known in a child neither beast nor human—or a pair of skinwalker parents may produce a skinwalker child, though these couplings can sometimes produce human children as well.

Skinwalkers resemble humans much of the time, but they possess the uncanny ability to transform into bestial humanoids who combine the most fearsome aspects of flesh and fur.

***Skin Walking.*** A skinwalker can change shape into a bestial form as a bonus action. A skinwalker may also enter this state as a reaction if they take damage that leaves you with less than half your maximum hit points. This bestial state is similar in function to the Alter Self spell: You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon as specified. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. While transformed, you cannot cast spells.

While in bestial form, a skinwalker has disadvantage on any charisma based checks other than intimidation while interacting with humanoids that lack the shapechanger subtype.

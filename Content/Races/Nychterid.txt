### Nocturnal Sharers
Nychterids are a race of sapient batfolk. They make their colonies in caves or large hollowed-out trees, preferring to live in forests or jungles. Most nychterid colonies have two locations, and like bats, make an annual migration between the two to stay with favorable weather and the availability of their preferred foods.

Nychterids are famously private as individuals, except within others of their colony. Most nychterids live in a commune of 2-6 other nychterids. No matter what a nychterid’s other vocation in life, within their communes, they share everything: living quarters, domestic labor, food, sexual partners and child-rearing responsibilities. Nychterids derive their surnames from their commune, which are chosen among its members, and may change when a new member is accepted into it. Nychterid children are given the surname of their birth commune until they join another.

This desire for relative insulation from others suits most nychterids just fine, as their resemblance to bats inspires a seemingly primal fear in folk, and they are often discriminated against, being thought to be harbingers of plague or disease, or the agents of vampires. This is, of course, ridiculous, and most nychterids maintain a diet of fruit and insects.

Everyone in nychterid society takes their turn in the kitchen, so most nychterids are gourmands. If a one has invited you to their home and prepared for you a meal, you know you have made a friend for life.

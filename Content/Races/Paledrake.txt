### An Inherited Grudge
It goes without saying that Dragonborn owe their heritage to the dragons. Paledrakes are a rare and unusual case where they can trace their lineage to one specific dragon. In a primordial era long since past, one dragon born without scales was denied his ageless birthright. He betrayed dragonkind, and helped wage war against them.

But he would not last against his brethren. Time would come for him much sooner than they, and so, alone, he created his progeny. Those who would carry his anger into eternity.

### Freedom From Mortality
Knowing his time was limited, the scaleless dragon conducted numberous experiments, the Paledrakes among them. Each experiment a desperate attempt to postpone the inevitable, until one bore fruit: a form of crystalized magic that preserved his flesh against the weathering of time. With it, he was unstoppable, but when his war was at its apex, the crystal was destroyed by a single, lowly human.

He was erased from the annals of history, and no dragon alive will ever admit to these events. The Paledrakes remain his only legacy, to this very day.

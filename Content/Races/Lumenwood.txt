___
The Lumenwood are a reclusive race who rarely interact with the outside world. Their bodies are firm and plantlike, with rootlike veins tracing over their pale blue bodies, and their symetrical hands bear six thin, nimble fingers.

### Voyagers from the Void
The origins of the Lumenwood are unknown to all but themselves, and they are not keen on sharing this particular secret. Their stilted, otherworldly movements lend credence to the common theory that they originate from beyond the stars. 

Even in the race instances of living among other races, their culture is a closely guarded secret, except for one curious companion that they each bear.

### A Peculiar Symbiosis
The majority of Lumenwood settlements border obscure inland seas, surrounded by thick mists for the benefit of a peculiar benefactor known as the Kin. Each Lumenwood bears a Kin within their body, a rubbery, sluglike parasite that creeps within their flesh, oftens een dangling from their spindly arms giving the appearance of roots or tentacles.

The precise relationship between the Kin and the Lumenwood is unknown, but the Lumenwood continue to cultivate the Kin in their secluded seaside villages. Perhaps the Kin and Lumenwood exchange the secrets from the deep sea and the distant stars.

### Lumenwood Names
With their bizarre, tree-like bodies, the Lumenwood defy traditional definition of gender. Each one seems to take a name purely out of preference.

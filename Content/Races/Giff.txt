*The fight was over in a flash. A literal flash, mind you, and a very loud boom. They had rigged an entire ship with barrels of gunpowder and fired on it themselves when pirates tried to board the vessel. As payment all they wanted was more barrels of gunpowder.*

Long ago the giff, a race of hippopotamus-headed humanoids, lost their home world. Since that time, they have been traveling the multiverse operating as mercenaries. Despite their itinerant society, their culture is highly structured. Every giff has a rank in a military hierarchy that includes all giff, with strict rules and guidelines for interacting with superiors, inferiors, and peers.

### Ungentle Giants
Even in crowded places, a giff stands out. Giff stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh over 300 pounds. If that wasn’t enough to attract attention, they are rarely seen wearing anything but garish military regalia. If the giff is particularly wealthy, it will also smell of gunpowder, which serves as both a currency and an aphrodisiac for the giff.

Asking a giff about their outfit, particularly a military medal, is likely to lead to a long monologue about the rarity of the award and the courage the giff displayed in earning it. Pipe smoking and wearing items such as glasses or monocles are popular affectations among giff.

### Weapons of War
The only thing that giff love more than military hierarchy is gunpowder and the weapons that use it. Young giff are taught to use pistols shortly after they learn to walk and muskets when they are capable of firing one without falling down from the recoil. It is tradition for a giff to be welcomed to adulthood by receiving a grenade from all close personal and professional associates. The giff is expected to use these gifts as soon as possible.

Despite their love of loud bangs and bright flashes of light, giff are ambivalent about magic. Exact attitudes vary depending on the giff, but it is very rare for giff to become spellcasters. Those giff that do learn to cast spells are assigned ranks that prevent them from rising too high in the chain of command. Spellcasters may also endure prejudice from other giff who accuse magic-users of being too cowardly to “fight fair.”

### Adventurers By Birth
Giff are born adventurers but the structure of their society, and their fondness for that structure, means few giff are interested in adventuring with non-giff. Instead, giff move from one mercenary adventure to the next with as many other giff as required to successfully complete the mission. Although giff are a proud people, they are not shy about ensuring they have all the reinforcements necessary to accomplish a job.

When giff do adventure with others it may be because they have been exiled. Giff spellcasters are often shunned by other giff, so they might join others who show more respect for their craft. Cowardice among giff is usually rewarded with a demotion but, if an act of cowardice caused sufficient loss of giff life, the offender could be exiled. Very rarely a giff simply chafes against the structure of its society or prefers the company of other peoples.

### Giff Names
Every giff has a personal name and a military rank and they insist, in almost all situations, to be called by this full title and name. Military rank titles are very specific, often including variations to identify particular honors the giff has earned. Personal names are typically short and simple. Giff take too much pride in their titles to be overly concerned with impressive names.

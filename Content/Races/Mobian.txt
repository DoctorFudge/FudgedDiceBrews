Mobians are characterized by being anthropomorphic animals, possessing a wide range of aspects, subspecies and colors. Physically they are characterized by a curious anatomy, as they have bodies of various shapes, some more muscular, others smaller, thinner, more corpulent etc. Most possess the quality of having thin legs and arms, and disproportionately large heads.

Mobians (especially males) do not usually wear a lot of clothes. The most common to see on them is the use of footwear that are usually of a large size, and similarly styled gloves. Others wear more complete clothing, such as dresses and jackets. It is also common for them to use accessories such as necklaces, bracelets, headphones and chains.

Mobians are usually no more massive than a halfling, regardless of the animal or being they represent, so it is not uncommon to see that they are able to move in any environment.

The most outstanding quality of mobians, is that many possess powers and abilities, both physical and magical, ranging from extreme speed to super strength. It is rare to find a mobian having not adventured at some point in their life.

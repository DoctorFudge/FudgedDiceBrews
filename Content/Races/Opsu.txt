### Nomadic Opportunists
The opossumfolk live in nomadic families of six to twelve members, and make their livings wherever the weather is good and the food is plentiful, preferring woodlands and jungles. Often erroneously thought to be bearers of disease by folk, opsu are actually clean and fastidious creatures. As their family travels, they will bargain for food and lodging in exchange for honest labor, an enterprise an entire family learns to pitch in with not long as soon as they can walk.

Opsu are efficient climbers, and so many become carpenters, lumberjacks or other work that takes advantage of their natural talents.

Female opsu have a pouch on their abdomens that they use to carry their young until they are mobile enough to get around on their own. The pouch is roughly six inches wide and four inches deep. Some opsu keep important and personal items, such as keys in their pouches, while others frown on this practice and consider it unsanitary.

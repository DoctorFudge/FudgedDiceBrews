-Anne Sexton

Brachyuran are a race of humanoids resembling crustaceans. They can live either on land or under the sea, often gathering in large colonies hidden deep within elaborate coral structures.

### Crab Mentality
The Brachyuran believe themselves the pinnacle of all evolution, and in many ways, they are not wrong. The Brachyuran people have in fact gone completely extinct several times. Their scholars labeled each of these extinctions as a Calamity, and have studied their myriad histories, revealing that other races have evolved into Brachyuran each time they have disappeared.

As a result of these extinctions, it is uncommon for the Brachyuran to worship any particular deities. Instead, as they believe themselves the ultimate forms of life, it is often assumed that the gods fear the Brachyuran, though the truth of the matter is a harsh lesson for those who wander to the outside world.

### Castles of Sand
One would describe Brachyuran society as hermit-like. Their opulent cities are rarely seen by outsiders, hidden deep within coral caves betwixt the land and sea where neither land or sea life could easily enter.

Once every great while, a young curious Brachyuran will venture forth to the surface, leaving his home behind to find a new life. The Brachyuran are so unwelcoming of outsiders it is said that even a child who has left the city will not be welcomed back. Perhaps this is a method for the Brachyuran nobility to remain convinced of their superiority.

### Brachyuran Names
The names of the Brachyuran are hard for outsiders to pronounce, often sounding like gurgling or bubbling.

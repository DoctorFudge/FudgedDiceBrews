An arrow flies in through the misty cloud surrounding the mountainside seconds of silence then an eagle falls from the heavens in clashes onto a rocky cliff side before landing in the thick snow in front of her feet.

These snowy Warriors are far and few, but welcome any snow Clan into their arms. Members of other races are kept at Bay until proven a great asset and battle.

They dare to hunt the most dangerous beasts, even when they will be days away from home.

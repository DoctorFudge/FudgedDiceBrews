### Of Water and Wood
The industrious beaverfolk live primarily along rivers, building tiered structures upon and within a its waters. They live in family groups of eight to twelve members, and by the time they are four years old, most have already learned how to swim and how to build. Cha’pa consider cooperation a virtue, so they teach their young how to work with others from an early age.

Cha’pa also take great pride in the craftsmanship, maintenance and expansion of their lodges, which afford them not only a roof over their head, but a constant food supply, all located somewhere inconvenient to their enemies. Clever cha’pa create sections of their dwellings that can be quickly detached, carried away by the river’s turbulent current, or lay hidden traps that utilize sharp wooden stakes as a deterrent to invasion. Some even keep a hidden chamber of the structure underwater, dry and with an air pocket, where their loved ones can retreat to until such time as a danger has passed.

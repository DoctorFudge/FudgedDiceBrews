[**Source:** *Lunaxi*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o_lRXcO01vkxEoEtsQncYzAxOq8Za7agzGiveTcE_0Y/edit)

Lunaxi are a humanoid race that largely appears human with elvish features, such as pointed ears. However, their hair is often frosty white with hints of pastel colors that one would only be able to attain via dyes. Their eyes are also said to always be colored by the evening sky. This color varies, often sourcing the hue of their hair color. Stars dot all over within, like they have nebulas and the cosmos within the windows to their soul. Generally they are known to be of somewhat average if not petit build. They have no mouth however, and often mask that area to avoid discomfort. The skin of the Lunaxi can be any color between a light cream to a dark chocolate, helping them draw in heat on the colder nights.

### History
Tens of thousands of years ago, an unnamed mother lay her dead child in the nighttime desert. The Moon Goddess saw their suffering and shed a tear, falling onto the child and guiding them to safety with her moonlight. In gratitude, the mother praised the Goddess and swore the lifelong devotion of her family to her. In return, the Goddess would continue to protect them under her light. Generations later, in the moonlit nights of endless travel, her descendants — the Lunxai — carry on her promise and the blessing. They also found purpose in the only deity who had mercy on them. At her command, they continue to roam, sharing her kindness with all they meet.

### Religion
The Lunaxi worship Selûne, a deity who dwells in a planar realm called the Gates of the Moon. Known as the Goddess of the Moon, the Moonmaiden, She Who Guides, she is the figure around which the Lunaxi have built their wardering civilization. Wherever her light leads, the Lunaxi follow.

Under the guidance of her moon above, they've built their society and raise their young to her teachings. Some take on owls as companions, others become navigators with the knowledge they've been given. Similar to the first child who was saved by Selune, they all take on names with lunar meaning, further tying themselves to her.

### Society
Nomads of vast steppes or arid places, they herd livestock of all types primarily for trading. Most Lunaxi will have some animal husbandry skills, depending on the clan and whether they are semi-nomadic or fully nomadic, sometimes this is with the dire wolves they ride into battle, but sometimes if semi-nomadic it is with the cows or goats that they breed for meat or milk in the pot.

Nowadays, Lunaxian tribes live a nomad life in the desert while maintaining commercial relationships with the major cities. Lunaxi society naturally recognize the goddess of the moon, Selûne while exiled often fall to Shar, the goddess of darkness, or embrace the Dark Moon heresy. Lunaxi are known for their high-skilled traders and guides. Rarely does a Lunaxi separate themselves entirely from their tribe, though those who do and settle are known for their farming.

### Lunaxi Names
Lunaxi are a tribal nomadic people and they do not usually use family surnames, rather sharing one for their entire caravan. Grand titles are given for performing impressive feats. Parents bring children before the tribe chief for the Naming Ceremony that is performed at maturity.

During this ceremony, a Lunaxi selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name, and is given a title based on their abilities. Each name is a unique creation, reflecting the hopes and desires of the person while tying them to their beliefs. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies.

### Wild Grimalkin
Wild grimalkin live in colonies of anywhere from five to five dozen members. Their loose governing structures tend to be matriarchal, with disagreements are settled through non-lethal play-combat. Resources and duties are shared equally but unevenly among its members. Each memberâ€™s individual skills and interests are put to use, from hunting to child-rearing to guard duty. They display a staggering variety of coats, from stripes, spots, tortoiseshell patterns, or solid colors.

Most wild grimalkin worship Ai-Apaec, a trickster archfey who favored the form of a cat, and from whom they believe they are descended.

### Urban Grimalkin
City grimalkin tend to follow one of two paths. Some take to a life of living on the streets, where their fierce independence makes them a loner living by their wits in a loose network of regular haunts. Harsh street living takes its toll, however, and their coats can become matted and mangy.

Others find a surrogate family to substitute for their colonies, seeking out a life of pampering by ingratiating themselves to a wealthy patron in exchange for the pleasure of their company. Some city grimalkin can become fussy and stuck in their ways. Their coats tend to be solid colors, or to have splendidly refined patterns in their fur, which can grow quite long (a product of selective breeding among their own kind). Others lose their hair entirely, displaying their loose, wrinkled skin with regal pride.

## Marionette
*"I’ve carved the puppet, and I manipulate the strings, but while it’s on stage, the show belongs to the puppet."*

Every actor has their time in the limelight, every toy has its time out of the toy chest, and every artist has their muse. But time passes, and interest wanes, and things are often left behind, in the dark corners to collect dust and be forgotten. Marionettes, from those used in theaters to simple childrens toys, are often subjected to this. 
  
A Marionette is a puppet or doll that, through some means, acquired a life of its own, letting it move around freely. Since being given life, they have become quite fond of their freedom, often making light of their neglect and abandonment.

### Fetchingly Festooned
Despite often being crafted from wood or porcelain, Marionettes are hard to tell apart from humans at a glance. Only their loose, jerky movements and unchanging faces would give them away from a distance. Their clothing, often bright and colorful to dazzle and entertain. is frquently attached directly to their bodies, although it can be replaced with minimal discomfort.
  
### Performers and Paramours
For a Marionette, all the world is a stage. They are natural performers and entertainers, and have a natural affinity for both the tragic and comedic sides of theater. They adore a good joke or prank, while often knowing just how to pull at ones heartstrings. They also often enjoy games, owing to their origin as toys.

Though some may find them unsettling and uncanny, they enjoy living among other races, and are often welcomed for their ability to put a smile on any face.

### Colorful Communities   
It is hard to call Marionettes a unified people. Their love of freedom and independence, combined with a tendency to travel means they do not often group together. Rarely, when they are shunned by a society, they may come together in a group referred to as a *Troupe*.

> ##### Relations with other races
> Marionette mix themselves into any society that will let them, and have garnered a number of opinions about themselves.
>  
> ***Humans.*** *"Honestly I find them a little creepy, but they try so hard."*
>  
> ***Elves.*** *"I recognized one that I used to play with a hundred years prior, and found myself apologizing to an old friend."*
>  
> ***Dwarves.*** *"You'd be daft if you think any old Bard can make a man laugh or cry the way they do."*
 
### Talented Travelers
Once they gain their independance Marionette don't stay in one place for long, so becoming adventurers is frequent, albeit incidental for them. They often seek new friends, new stages, or simply new fun things to try.
  
### Marvelous Monickers
Marionettes usually keep the names their former owners gave them, which vary wildly depending on their origin from simple names given to them by children that played with them to more dramatic ones from their old puppeteers. Given that a Marionette may have been a family heirloom before their awakening, those who take family names often look to theater, or use the ones of their old owners.

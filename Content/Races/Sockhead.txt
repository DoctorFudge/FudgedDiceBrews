## Sockheads
[**Source:** *Sockheads*](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MN-pILBAo1Sr8FmMKzQ)

Hailing from the mysterious land of Kent, Ohio, these creatures are very much like humans... except more... sock-like, and appearing to be made out of bits of old garden decorations and similar. No two are truly alike, and nobody's ever seen anything quite like them.

### Chill Out, Man
While sockheads vary wildly in demeaner, typically they embody what it means to be a "slacker". They are largely apathetic and unaffected, expressing little interest in the greater problems of the day and caring very little about anger directed in their direction.

### Rock!
Sockheads love music, especially loud music they can party to. They'll blow all of their funds on following bands around on tour, and party as hard as any creature can. In large enough numbers, sockheads have even been known to level entire cities with their partying.

### Crescent Fresh
Sockheads speak primarily in Common, but sprinkle in a few slang terms that are unfamiliar to many in the Realms. One in particular is "Crescent Fresh", referring to a number of things, such as nice guys who fly kites and have nice girls who like them, or hippies who like hacky-sack and don't eat meat or smoke crack. Other words include "bah-shwag" and whatever other unintelligible collection of syllables they decide to use to refer to something. Kind of like a more modern version of the Jabberwocky.

### Sockhead Names
Sockhead names are often normal names, but many sound very strange, either being jumbled up messes to pronounce or bearing descriptive words that don't really mean anything in context.

**Male Names:** Sifl, Olly, Zafo, Precious Roy, Chester, Carl, Diplo, Clicksby, Dewey, Croissant, Tines, Cozy Bishop, Stealth, Peto, Flek, Jargon Scott, Grout, Jimmy, Julio, Cody

**Female Names:** Sex Girl, Gretchen-Peters, Peaches, Molly, Zebra, Zanzibar, Serena, Momm, Dop, Dot

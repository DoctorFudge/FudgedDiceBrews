Hailing from the strange land of Hollownest, surrounded by an ancient kingdom once great, now filled with monsters crawling through it's tunnels and out of the cracks unseen. Vessels are a rare creature, ones that find themselves wandering around these ruins, with origins unknown, even to themselves. Most Vessels go to search for answers as to who they are or were, going down the path of the adventurer in hopes of achieving such goals.

If the attack hits, you are propelled ten feet into the air, where you remain until the start of your next turn. On your next turn, you may either make an acrobatics check (DC13) to land in a space within 5 feet of your current spot, or make one melee weapon attack to attempt to be propelled ten feet above the target of the attack. This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity *unless* the attack misses.

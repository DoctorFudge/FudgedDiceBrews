## Kitsune
Kitsune, or fox spirits, have the ability to shapeshift back and forth between fox and more desirable humanoid forms. Despite an irrepressible penchant for deception, Kitsunes prize loyalty and make true companions. Most Kitsune are fascinated with the adventurers they meet, often joining them in their travels to try and satisfy their inquisitive nature. Because of this spirit of curiosity, they are wonderfully suited to the adventuring life.

***Age.*** Kitsune rarely live to be a millennium, gaining a new tail as they grow older. Kitsune who live long enough to have nine tails cease to age, effectively becoming immortal.

***Alignment.*** Due to their nature of being a bit mischievous, kitsune are often chaotic. Even the most skilled monks find it difficult to ignore the desire to be a bit mischievous at times, but they tend to approach the trick in a much more planned out and guided manner. Kitsune are known to be both good and evil.

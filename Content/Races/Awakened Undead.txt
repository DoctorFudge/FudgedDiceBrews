## Awakened Undead
[**Source:** *Awakened Undead*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1grrEmgXFuzrnMbY5joimPD9v_NEp89IM/view)

*The mists of the Valeheart woods cling to the tall, charred pines that dot the landscape. A breeze billows between the trees, making the miasma flow like clawed, spectral fingers, imbuing it with a sinister semblance of life. Locals speak dark legends of this place, cursed with an evil nature that has spanned centuries. Though no two tales are the same, they all agree on one point: how willing the very air of this place is to choke the life out of any foolish mortals that venture inside.*

*Nevertheless, a gnarled dwarf by the name of Blidwenn gazes into the opaque vapor streaming from the trees, his eyes more accustomed to the dim light of this place than the pure sunshine found in more wholesome lands. Braiding a few errant strands of beard, Blidwenn continues his vigil for well on an hour, tracing the elusive forms in the mist for any sign of living movement. Clasping his braid in a ruddy, calloused hand, the dwarf lets loose a sigh and slowly rises to his feet.*

*His sharp dwarven eyes snap open and he pauses instantly mid-motion. Movement in the mists, shadows, a shape emerging from the woods. His vision traces the outline of a lean, solitary figure, set bone white against the grey fog. With slow, creaking footsteps, the creature emerges from the fog and advances on the steadfast dwarf.*

*"That you, Clacks?" Blidwenn rumbles, his hammer suddenly finding itself in his large hands, "You see anything in there?"*

*"Indeed, friend," the approaching skeleton replies dryly, holding aloft a faint, purple gem, "The master’s old phylactery wasn’t nearly as well defended as he would have us think."*

Death comes for all things in a near-infinite variety of ways. So, too, are there many reasons that the dead might return from the grave. Directly-applied necromancy, cursed lands, and unfinished business are but a few, and all leave the newly-undead soul with a mere semblance of the life it had before. All undead carry the physical or emotional scars of what ended their mortal lives, though some may be far more subtle than others.

### Dead and Reborn
Typically having no lands to call their own, undead with an awakened sense of self are usually perpetual foreigners, wanders in a land and often a time they do not belong to. Compounding matters, most mortal cultures carry with them an instinctual fear of death and the dead, and many associate necromancy specifically with dark tidings. This forms a wall of (often well-earned) prejudice and hatred that sentient undead find themselves up against, and many undead choose to hide their necrotic natures behind clothes, masks, and pungent perfumes when journeying into civilization.

Depending on composition, humanoid undead typically range a wide gamut from 20 to 300 pounds, and may possess empty eyes, a colored flame-like magical animus in their sockets, or harrowed, surprisingly mortal eyes burning with an inner fire. Hair (if they have it at all) is usually lank, dark, and wrought with grime and gravedirt that no amount of cleaning will fully remove.

### Service and Freedom
Undeath is effectively immortality, a strong reason why many mortal spellcasters of a certain moral bent consider it a viable alternative to actually dying. Still, it is not immortality without a price; senses and emotions dull, food and drink no longer have taste, and often an undead state comes alongside a subservience of will and unthinking toil beneath a merciless and malevolent master.

Some undead are born into freedom, while others earn it or have it thrust upon them. Regardless, all undead that are not bound greatly cherish their liberday, as the reminders of what could easily happen were they not fortunate enough to possess free will abound throughout history. Many awakened undead consider it their sacred duty to free other mindless undead, or simply to dispatch them wherever they may be found. The reasoning is straightforward enough: a final rest awarded to all mortals is greatly preferential to eternal slavery to the likes of a short-sighted, megalomaniacal spellcaster.

### Fallen Home, Forgotten Past
For many awakened undead, the past is a distant homeland to which they may never return, holding names and faces now partially-forgotten, and loves and lives as dead as they are. The anguish of this loss is enough to drive many mad, but others use this rage and pain as a source of power and drive, carrying them further on the road to whatever dark destiny awaits.

Frequently, entire countries, customs, and cultures an undead may be familiar with no longer exist, and the sentient dead behaves or speaks in an antiquated fashion because of this. These undead may find it more difficult than usual to relate to modern mortals, usually leveraging what companions they find to bridge this epoch-long communication gap.

### Undead Names
Many undead that awaken into sentience prefer to keep the names they held in their mortal lives. For others, however, their mortal names are forgotten or have lost meaning. These undead often adopt nicknames given to them by their former masters or present companions, and hold them to be as true as any other creature’s birth name.

Examples of names given in this fashion can be seen, below:

**Names:** Bane, Carver, Clatter, Crumble, Drudge, Minion, Mort, Pale, Rattlebones, Raven, Rook, Rotface, Shade, Shiver, Spore, Wisp

### Awakened Undead Racial Traits
Regardless of type, all awakened undead have the following traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Alignment.*** Many awakened undead cling to the alignment they held in life. For others, death changes them significantly, and they adopt a new worldview in light of what their death has taught them.

***Dead Immortality.*** You do not age. Given time, the necromantic energies that sustain you will heal most wounds you take at approximately the same rate as a mortal, and your hit dice function as normal.

***Past Life.*** Choose another race besides this one, which must be humanoid and lack the Living Construct trait (or similar). Before your death, you were a member of this race and appear as an undead version of it. Your size, height, and movement speed are the same as a typical member of that race. You do not retain special movement speeds from this race (such as swimming or flying) or any of the race’s other racial traits. If your Past Life race has subraces, you can select one, but it confers no benefits.

***Living Dead.*** You have been raised from death, but regaining your autonomy has returned to you some of the spark of life. You are immune to disease. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. Additionally, you have two creature types: humanoid and undead. You can be affected by a spell or ability if it works on either of your creature types.

***Restless.*** As an undead, you very rarely tire. You treat exhaustion as if it was one level less. In addition, instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.

***Unholy.*** Unlike other undead, you can be restored through healing magic, but it has a significantly dampened effect on you. When you regain hit points from a source that specifies it does not function on undead, you only receive half as many hit points as the source would normally provide, rounded down.

***Darkvision.*** Through the necromantic energy animating you, you are able to perceive with greater clarity that which lurks in the darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Bloodless.*** You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language, typically one available to the race you chose for your Past Life. If your Past Life race has a trait that precludes speech (such as a kenku’s Mimicry), you are still not able to speak and instead gain access to the relevant trait of your Past Life race that substitutes speech.

***Subrace.*** Five types of awakened undead are available to you. Choose Skeleton, Revenant, Ghost, Ghoul, or Mummy, listed in the following section.

#### Skeleton
An animated figure made of dry bones devoid of flesh and muscle, you were likely raised by a necromantic caster or dark, supernatural curse as a simple minion, completely without will and self knowledge. Something changed, however; perhaps your master was slain, the land cleansed, or you merely awoke one day to fragmented memories of your previous life. Whatever the case, possessed of a fledgling sense of self and newfound purpose, you struck out into the wider world to find a new destiny.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity or Intelligence score increases by 2.

***Bone Pile.*** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. If you do, you reduce yourself to a pile of bones, render yourself prone, and are considered to be under a similar effect to the *feign death* spell. While subject to this condition, you are unable to move or take actions other than using an action to end this effect. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

***Them Bones.*** Whenever both of your hands are unoccupied, you can use a bonus action to rearrange the bones in your body, or to return your body to its original configuration. When you rearrange your bones, choose one of the following options, any of which are considered to occupy both of your hands:
___
- **Bone Club.** You remove an arm and use it as a bone club. While used as a weapon, you have proficiency with your removed arm, which is a melee weapon with the finesse property that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit.
- **Bone To Pick.** You remove a hand, and hold it in your other hand as if it were a set of thieves’ tools. This hand is capable of picking locks, cutting glass, and any other function thieves’ tools could achieve.
- **Bone Xylophone.** You remove two of your ribs and use the rest of your remaining ribs as a musical instrument, with which you have proficiency.

At your DM’s option, you can use this trait to perform other tasks, such as juggling your own bones, removing your skull to look around a corner or over a wall, or similar. Your bones lose their animation if they are further than 5 feet from the majority of your body, and must be reattached before they are once again a part of you. If your skull loses animation, you are blinded and deafened until a skull is affixed to your body.

#### Revenant
When a brutal murder or an atrocious crime slays an innocent soul endowed with sufficient willpower, there are rare occasions where the victim refuses to stay dead. You were not created at the whim of a mortal spellcaster. Rather, either a god interceded in your death, or you had too much willpower to give into death. This usually occurs at least a full day, though sometimes centuries, after your death occurred.

Born again out of an undying thirst for vengeance, you will not rest until the wrongs surrounding your death have been righted. Though you superficially appear similar to a zombie, complete with tattered flesh and sporadic decay, your eyes gleam with an intelligent intent, a burning passionate fury that will bring your vengeance to those who have wronged you.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma or Strength score increases by 2.

***Eternal Vengeance.*** You know at all times the general direction of and relative distance to a specific intelligent creature of the DM’s choosing against whom you seek revenge for your death, even if the creature and you are on different planes of existence. Should this creature die by your hand or that of another, you instantly know, and your DM chooses another creature also responsible for your death for this feature to apply to, should such a creature exist.

***Driven.*** You have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead or would cause you to be frightened.

***Unnatural Vitality.*** When you drop to 0 hit points, you can choose to stay conscious instead of falling unconscious. If you do, you gain temporary hit points equal to your total character level + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1), which last for up to one minute.

In this state, you can take an action or bonus action on your turn, but not both, and can move only half of your movement speed. You remain in this state until you regain hit points, or until you no longer have temporary hit points. If you lose all temporary hit points in this state while you are still at 0 hit points, you fall unconscious and begin making death saving throws as normal.

Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Ghoul
Feral, horrifying, and ravenous, ghouls hunt in packs, driven by an unending hunger for the flesh of the living and the dead alike. Corpselike with a whip-like tongue, long fangs, and clawlike fingers, ghouls are immune to decomposition and typically retain a corrupted semblance of how they appeared in life. Most ghouls possess even less sense of self than the average undead, but, for better or worse, your individuality has returned to you. The dark cravings that drive you to feed continue, however, and you must reconcile your newfound self awareness with your compulsion to consume.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 2.

***Natural Weapons.*** You possess both claws and fangs, either of which you can use as an unarmed strike. Your fangs deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, while your claws deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your choice of either your Strength or Dexterity modifier. In addition, you can use Dexterity in place of Strength for attack rolls made with your claws.

***Feeding.*** Though undead do not need to eat to continue existing, you are compelled through a dark curse to feed. As an action when you are adjacent to a dead or prone creature that is not an aberration, construct, elemental, ooze, plant, or undead, you can render yourself prone as well and attempt to feed on them.

If the creature is alive, make an unarmed strike attack with your fangs, dealing damage on a hit as usual. If this attack hits, or if the creature is already dead, you regain hit points equal to your Constitution modifier + your total character level. Once you successfully use this ability, you can not use it again until you complete a short or long rest. You still feel hunger, and can feed on flesh without regaining hit points, however.

***Curse of the Abyss.*** Ghouls were created to feed, and suffer a compulsion to do so. If a creature you can see drops to 0 hit points and you have not used your Feeding ability since your last long rest, you must attempt a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 15 – half your total character level, rounded down, unless that creature is of a creature type that can not be fed upon.

If you fail this saving throw, on each of your turns you must move to the creature by the shortest possible distance, using the Dash action if necessary. Once you reach the creature, you are compelled to use your Feeding ability with it as the target. You can repeat this Wisdom saving throw on each of your turns, This compulsion ends when you succeed on this saving throw, or after you have successfully fed upon the triggering creature.

***Paralytic Claws.*** When you hit a creature that is not undead or an elf with an attack using your claws, you can attempt to paralyze them. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. If the creature fails, it is incapacitated and unable to use its movement until the end of your next turn. Once you use this ability successfully, you can not use it again until you complete a long rest.

#### Mummy
Forgotten kings, sorcerers, slaves, and criminals of ancient empires, most mummies remain isolated in deep tombs and temples. Embalmed and wrapped in layers of treated linens scrawled with profane sigils, a mummy is gaunt and withered, yet shockingly powerful. The necromantic ritual that imbues a mummy with undeath only sometimes confers intelligence, a luxury almost always reserved for those of high social standing attempting to escape death. Was self awareness given to you with a purpose, or was your awakening an accident born of dark magic? Though usually content to haunt the lost ruins of their past lives, a scant few mummies venture abroad in search of revenge, missing treasures, or sinister motives beyond even their own knowing.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength, Wisdom, or Charisma score increases by 2.

***Mummy Rot.*** You can choose to make your unarmed strike deal necrotic damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and any creature hit by your unarmed strike is unable to regain hit points until the end of your next turn. If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by your unarmed strike, it instantly disintegrates into dust, leaving behind any objects, clothing, or items on its person.

***Dreadful Glare.*** As a bonus action, choose a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. This creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. If it fails, this creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Once you use this ability successfully, you can not use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

***Canopic Resurrection.*** Your heart has been removed from your person, and stored in a canopic jar in a safe location. While your heart is intact and within this jar, you can reroll one death saving throw you have made. If you roll a 17 or higher on this rerolled saving throw, treat the result as if it was a natural 20. Once you reroll a death saving throw with this trait, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.

#### Necropolitan
For all the arguable benefits it offers, some souls seek out the gifts of undeath, sacrificing their mortality for a chance at ever-greater power. Necropolitans are oncemortals who have undergone the ritual of Crucimigration, a painful process that strips them of their mortality and replaces it with a dark necromantic energy. A necropoplitan’s skin tightens and bleaches or becomes ashen, and the irises of their eyes pale to a frosty blue-white.

Crucimigration itself has similarities to certain paths to lichdom, and rumor has it that becoming a necropolitan can be the first step towards transforming into a lich, gradually and free of the terrible sacrifices usually involved in such a process. Stories also abound of a mysterious city named Nocturnus, hidden away and filled with the undead, where necropolitans rule throngs of mortals that aspire to become as undead as their masters.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence or Charisma score increases by 2.

***Dead Fortitude.*** As a bonus action on your turn, you can pull upon the necromantic force animating you to gain temporary hit points equal to your total character level + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) that last for up to one minute. Once you use this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

***Tools of the Grave.*** You gain proficiency with your choice of one of the following sets of tools: alchemist’s supplies, calligrapher’s supplies, leatherworker’s tools, or the poisoner’s kit.

***Necropolitan Magic.*** You know the chill touch cantrip. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the ray of enfeeblement spell once per day; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Choose either Intelligence or Charisma as your spellcasting ability for these spells.

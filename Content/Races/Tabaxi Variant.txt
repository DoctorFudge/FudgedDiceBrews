Though folklore and common sense made sure most avoided the dungeon under the mountain, someone had been here recently. Indeed, winding through the corridors of forlorn masonry, a trail of deftly disarmed traps and skillfully picked locks leads to a small feline adventurer, a singular torch, anda large sack of loot. This diminutive figure, covered in white and orange fur with a long trailing green cloak, fully understands they should turn back, that they've found enough. But one final locked door confronts them, alongside their pressing, implacable curiosity, driving them to discover whatlies behind it.

Beset by ravening gnolls that seek to make the savannah their own lifeless hunting ground, a powerful  leonine warrior hefts his mace in a large paw, bringing it down in a brutal blow directly into the skull of one of his adversaries. The warrior wheels around with cat-like grace, striking with his claws at the eyes of a second gnoll in one single, fluid motion.

Pondering a tome forgotten to time, a tufted and wizened tabaxi gingerly uses a claw to turn an aged page. Beside the open tome sits a length of chain and an opened lock, formerly used to secure the book shut. Though the secrets contained within were considered forbidden for good reason, the tabaxi pouring throughits pages needed answers, and, of course, to sate her unrelenting search for knowledge.

Though everyone knows that no two cats are alike, few account for the dramatic variance between breeds of tabaxi. Even the tabaxi themselves do not differentiate culturally between themselves and their kin of other ancestry, considering all tabaxi to be different manifestations of the same race. Nevertheless, such differences do exist, and create pronounced traits that lend each tabaxi certain aptitudes not found in others of their species.

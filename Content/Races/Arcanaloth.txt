## Arcanaloth
[**Source:** *The Arcanaloth*](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/527604-the-arcanaloth)

### Lost Potential
Arcanaloths are powerful fiends of the icy plane of Gehenna. While most of the subspecies hold extreme power since birth, some have been exiled, drained of power by some inscrutable reason, or chose to travel to the Material Plane on their own. For whatever reason, an Arcanaloth would only join a group of adventurers for knowledge and money. Being significantly weaker weaker than the rest of their species, they often hold bitter grudges against all other feindish races, especially Teiflings. Their intelligence is already higher than the average humans, but their lost potential still leaves them wanting for more.

### Keeping the Appearance
While adventurer Arcanaloths have lost most of their magical power, that does not mean they have lost everything. They dress themselves in the finest robes and armor, groom themselves constantly, and keep their spellbooks far from their party's grubby hands. They have also lost their ethereal sight, which they often complain about. They adore to make fun of humans, but they also know of their race's conquests.

### Arcanaloth Names
Arcanaloths have two names: their given name and their true name. True names are in Abyssal, and can be as short as one word and as long as a page. The fiends only share their true name with those they most trust, often spouses and the closest of friends that they have spent decades with. Given names are often mirrored of the race that they spent a long time with, like a Dwarven name if they lived amongst Dwarves. No matter the name, it is regal and often draped with titles.

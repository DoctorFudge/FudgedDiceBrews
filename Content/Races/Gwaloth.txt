### Growing Together
Gwaloth have the appearance of lithe, vine-covered halflings. They have growths that resemble hair and beards, and often have a nest of petals sprouting from the tops of their heads. Gwaloth never tolerate shoes, and prefer a thick coating of raw earth around their root- like feet. They prefer to live in sun-dappled forests and jungles, with a tall overhead canopy, although some tribes favor swamps or mountainous scrubland. They avoid deserts or any place without fertile soil.

Gwaloth favor their attachment to fertile earth so much that Gwaloth priests, governors and others of station in their societies literally put their roots down, never leaving their planting positions as a public sign of their dedication.

Gwaloth are especially hardy creatures for their size, and can be notoriously difficult to exterminate. Thankfully, they prefer a live-and-let-live philosophy, with many of their tribes (which they call “gardens”) taking a vow a strict pacifism as part of adult rites.

Gwaloth love to trade favors and gifts. If a gwaloth produces fruit from their own body and offers it to you, you know you have made a friend for life.

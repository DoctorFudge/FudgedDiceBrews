Tyrants are a race of marauding demons, originally hailing from one of the many layers of the Abyss. While every fiend seeks to increase their own power, typically through violent means, Tyrants rely primarily on artifice and science, acquired through their brute force or bartery with other planes. Their hulking bodies are lined with technology combined with strange Abyssal magics.

### From the Pit
Tyrants have long served as wardens and slavers of the infernal pits, but due to their greater intellect and understanding of artifice, are seemingly more amicable than other demons.

Many Tyrants find themselves living in other planes as merchants or adventurers. They are always keen to barter and can be easily bribed with new technologies and relics, espescially those that may increase their standing in the Abyss.

### Flesh and Metal
Tyrants could be called more social than other demons. If nothing else they understand that a weaker Tyrant sets a bad example, and thus many of their pilfered technologies are reverse engineered for the improvement of all Tyrants. This pragmatism drives them ever onward in pursuit of power, avoiding infighting in favor of strengthening their overall presence. 

### Tyrant Names
Tyrants use similar naming contentions to other demons, often having grim meanings in Abyssal.

**Names:** Argath, Balvomo, Gornenad, Hastur, Istral, Kilgith, Melromun, Ollmonuuth, Rorgiug, Seggellog, Urmeth, Xol'gomaz.

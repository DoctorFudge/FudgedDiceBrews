*"One year when the orcs came to pillage, it seemed like the harvest itself had had enough. They say potatoes have eyes, but it seems it was the corn watching us till the fields all along, learning to use our tools. The orcs didn't come back next year. Didn't like it when the crops bit back."*

Magic is an unpredictable thing. Sometimes a wizard gets embroiled in a war seven centuries ago and it seeps into the soil. Sometimes unseelie fey curse a land just for fun. Sometimes druids go a bit mad and get run off of sacred grounds, and run screaming into the woods never to be seen again. One way or another, magic gets into the dirt and normal nonmagical farmers see nothing more than fertile land to grow something in
 
Often times this results in an unusually large pumpkin, such that one may mistake it for a horsedrawn carriage. Other times a beanstalk can sprout and cause great aggravation to local Storm Giants, or mushrooms that tiny folk build villages out of. But once in a great while, a Corn is born.

### Against the Grain
Corn, sometimes called Maizers or Gritmen, are magical vegetation, resembling small humanoid ears of corn. They often stand only a few feet tall, and wear clothes made of their own discarded husks. Their wispy silken hair comes in various shades of blonde and red, though other colors are rarely spotted as well. Their bodies are covered in numerous kernels, which if removed can regrow much like a humans teeth.

### Roots Running Deep
Corn are born from nature, and so they often live among it, and often serve as protectors of farmlands and wild fields. Corn are simple folk who prefer a simple life, content to work fields for many years. Hardy and stubborn, they can spend generations in one place, and so long as crops continue to grow they are happy.

Like all plants however, they seek to spread their seed across the land, and so later in life they often take to wandering and adventure.

### From the Field so Fallow   
Being of rare birth, Corn have no real society of their own. They live among farmers, tending to their breatheren and protecting villages from wandering threats. They will often stay close to where they are born, so long as no one there tries to eat them.
 
A family of Corn is called a *Stalk*, and can be anywhere from two to a hundred, as they consider all corn from the same field to be family. Hierarchy in the Stalk is determined by age, with the eldest Corn being called a rooter. The rooter keeps record through collected stories.

### Unstoppable and Unpoppable.
In spite of their beguiling appearance, Corn often find careers as adventurers if they grow weary of farm life. Their fearless and stubborn nature allows them to delve deep into the darkest of dungeons, and their abilities put them on par with any human warrior.

A corn may take up adventuring to protect their fields, find new lands, spread their seeds for the next generation, or simply out of boredom.

*We spent all day and all night trying to dig those villagers out of the collapsed mine. When the rest of us passed out from exhaustion she just kept at it. By the time I woke up, they were all free and she hadn’t broken a sweat.*

Half-dwarves, known as muls on some worlds, are the rare offspring between human and dwarven parents. Dwarven culture is conservative and implicitly forbids relationships between dwarves and other races, so most half-dwarves are born in times of social upheaval or as the result of a secret romance. Half-dwarves raised among dwarves are social pariahs, seen by their community as a living embodiment of the consequences of breaking with tradition. Raised among humans, half-dwarves experience prejudice and stereotypes related to their dwarven heritage.

### Born Outsiders
To humans, half-dwarves look like dwarves. To dwarves, half-dwarves look like humans. Half-dwarves stand between 4 and a half to 5 and a half feet tall and weigh around 200 pounds. They aren’t as stocky as dwarves but have a broader stature and more muscular physique than humans. Half-dwarves exhibit a range of skin tones and hair colors, but have notably thick and full hair.

Half-dwarves have experimental senses of fashion, taking dwarven and human traditions and blending them. Novel hairstyles and colors, or ways of wearing facial hair and jewelry are things that half-dwarves do to create their own identity. These styles are rarely subdued and cause half-dwarves to stand out in a crowd.

### Iconoclasts and Innovators
Routinely reminded by humans and dwarves alike that they have no unique culture of their own, half-dwarves are often rebels and revolutionaries. This manifests in a variety of ways, from forsaking the local religious customs to experimenting in new forms of art to advocating for vast and dramatic political changes. If proponents of the status quo suggest they shouldn’t even exist, half-dwarves have no reason to embrace the cultural institutions that stand against them. This tendency to align against tradition means half-dwarves often participate in countercultural movements and befriend other social misfits.

### Half-Dwarf Names
Half-dwarves tend to use either human or dwarf names. Those raised in human communities are usually given dwarven names and those raised in dwarven communities usually given human names.

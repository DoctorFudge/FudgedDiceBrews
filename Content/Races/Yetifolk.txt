#### Cold Hands, Warm Hearts
Hardy and reclusive, most yeti prefer to patrol the same forested mountains or snowy mountain peaks, and almost all yeti prefer a life of near-total solitude. They are tall, hirsute creatures, covered in fur. Some have decorative horns atop their heads.

Yeti form tight-knit family groups only for a short time and for a singular purpose: to rear their young, which are almost always single births. There is almost no substance known that is more nutritious than the blue milk of a nursing yeti, and infant yeti reared on the stuff grow so quickly than in a few short years, the trio separate and each goes their own way. After rearing or losing a child, most yeti wait at two or three decades before starting a new family.

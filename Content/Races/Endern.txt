Vwoop!  

From far off, this sound carries through the chilly but still night air. 
  
"Damn it, I missed him again!" The blond-haired and fully-bearded dwarf snarls, and puts another bolt into his large crossbow. 
  
**Vwoop!** The noise was much louder this time around. The Dwarf suddenly sees 2 glowing purple orbs, and a dark shadow. Spooked, he fires his crossbow at the shadow.
  
**Vwoop!** The noise is far off again...and the bolt is right near the dwarven marksman's feet. Drawing a shortsword, the dwarf sees those familair purple orbs lock in on him. 
  
"It is just another few hours...It's already been two though-"
  
**Vwoop!** The dwarf slashes at the Endern as he finally gets into striking range. He had only pretended to get distracted. The Endern falls over, whimpering.
  
"Cut it out, we both know you can talk. So, Mr. Nizernax, start talking...It will be day soon. You won't like it then, that we both know too!"  

### Abberations From the End of Time
Endern are a peculiar race of humanoid. They hail from a land they refer to in their language as the 'End'. Little is known about this place, not because they are hiding it, but rather becuase the Endern simply do not have much knowledge of their old exisitence.

Some retain 'memories', but even those that do can only access them rarely, and seem to be unable to process their imagery themselves, as though by magic. 

The Endern in truth are among the last of creatures to exist in any of the planes. And as time wore on and on, life grew dull. So, through a powerful Wish, several hundred Endern were sent back to what was considered the beginning of known time...about a few thousand years ago in the material plane, as the oldest surviving artifacts at the 'End' were from that time.

The End was a cold, dark, infinite expanse, dotted by floating islands, and ancient floating boats to guide them. The land in the 'End' was so old, so worn, that only certain plants could grow.

The Endern were sent back to collect data, knowledge, but none know their purpose even becuase the spell cast was flawed.

Doomed to wander the earth forever abberant nomads without a real origin, the Endern nevertheless try to live their lives to the fullest, with their intullectual pursuits ranking highly in their priorities. 

### Endern Racial Traits
As an Endern, you have the following traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Endern are very mentally capable, and also because of their physiology they are rather nimble. Your Intelligence Score increases by 2, and your Dexterity Score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Endern, as abberations from the end of time, have evolved so highly that after a certain age, they start to exponentially slow down their own aging. Endern do not die of old age, but an Endern, in the rare case one is born, will reach maturity at roughly 16 years of age.  

***Alignment.*** Endern are usually Neutral, preferring to keep to their own small communities, or just to themselves. However, Endern are usually Lawful as well, they do not break rules often (although they do have a temper). 

***Size.*** Endern are very, very tall humanoids, but they also very thin and stretched out. The tallest stand at nearly 9 feet in height, but weigh under 250 pounds in almost all cases. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 35 feet, you have an exceptional stride.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in direct sunlight, you have disadvantage on Attack Rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

***Abberant Physiology.*** You are both an Abberation and a Humanoid, and you can be affected by spells and effects that can target either. Endern do not require food or drink.

***Teleportation.*** You are adept at teleporting from place to place, as the need arises for you to escape situations. You can use Teleportation as a reaction to taking damage from an attack or spell. If you do so, you teleport 30 feet to an unoccupied place you can see. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your half your Intelligence modifier rounded up, (minimum of 1) per short or long rest.

***Water Aversion.*** Endern are averted to water in it's purest form overall. In fact, while it's raining on you or you're immersed in water you have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

***Endern Trance.*** Endern don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After Resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Deep Speech.

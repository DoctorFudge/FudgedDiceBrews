Centuries ago, the gnolls of the Znir Pact turned their backs on the worship of fiends, resolving to live as free people. Chapter 4 discusses their role in Droaam and across the land of Khorvaire. Your gnoll character has the following racial traits.

### Gnoll Names
The most important identifier for a Znir gnoll is its whoop. While deceptively short, a whoop includes a range of ultrasonic inflections that indicate clan, a personal identifier, and a suggestion of family affiliation (the Znir trace lineage through the mother). Because it’s impossible for most non-gnolls to properly replicate a whoop, gnolls also use contract names—names intended to be used with clients and other outsiders. There is a basic structure of contract names used by all gnolls; the inflection of the name indicates gender, though few people recognize this if they don’t speak Gnoll. The Znir typically attach clan name to a formal introduction: “Ghyrryn Barrakas, Znir.”

**Gnoll Contract Names:** Dagnyr, Dhyrn, Ghyrryn, Gnasc, Gnoryc, Gnyrn, Gnyrl, Hyrn, Lhoryn, Lhyr, Lhyrl, Mognyr, Myrl, Sorgnyn, Thyrn, Toryc, Yrgnyn, Yrych

### Gnoll Racial Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 1. In addition, either your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Young gnolls grow with uncanny speed. A gnoll is capable of fending for itself after only a few months, and is considered an adult at 5 years of age. Gnolls live to be around 30 years old. They remain vigorous until the end; death by old age is marked by a catastrophic decline over a space of a few days. Many believe this unusual lifecycle is tied to the supernatural origins of the gnoll.

***Size.*** Gnolls are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 250 to 320 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Bite.*** Your teeth are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with your bite, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Hunter’s Senses.*** You gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: Perception, Stealth or Survival.

***Rampage.*** On your turn, when you make an unarmed strike using your bite attack or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an attack, you can use a bonus action to move up to half your speed and make a weapon attack or bite attack.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Gnoll, and your choice of either Common or Goblin.

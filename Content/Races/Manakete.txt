### Manakete Racial Traits
***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score by 2, and your Intelligence or Charisma scores by 1.

***Age.*** You mature far faster than humans, attaining the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 7, reaching physical adulthood in your third century and live for a minimum of a millennium.

***Alignment.*** Manaketes are typically Neutral Good but can be found in any spectrum of the Good and Neutral alignments, often representing a variety of circumstances in their upbringing. Shadow Manaketes are corrupted by the rituals that made them, causing an innate tendency toward evil.

***Size.*** Manaketes are generally 4 to well over 7 feet tall, some leaning to the shorter end while others stand on the taller end. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Language.*** Common, Draconic, and one language of your choice

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Draconic Transformation.*** As a bonus action, you can assume your true dragon form. This transformation lasts for 1 minute until you die, or until you revert to your normal appearance as a bonus action. When you transform, your size increases to large, giving you advantage on grapple attempts and a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You also gain benefits that depend on your draconic subrace, described below.

While transformed you cannot use weapons besides your claws and cannot cast any spells. Once you shift back, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Breath Weapon.*** While transformed, you can use your action to exhale destructive energy in the form of a breath weapon, dealing damage type based on your subrace. All creatures in the area of your breath weapon must make a Dex Save with a DC of 8 + Cha + Prof. A creature takes 2d8 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d8 at the 6th level, 4d8 at 11th, and 5d8 at the 16th level. You can use your breath weapon a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier before a long rest.

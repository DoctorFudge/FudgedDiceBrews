### Bearfolk of the Wilds
The ursine are a race of bearlike humanoids that prefer to live in forests. When encountered by the ignorant, they are commonly mistaken for werebears or even the odd sasquatch. These misunderstandings have driven most ursine tribes deep into wildernesses, far from the bustling metropolises of the world.

Ursine have large heads, noses, ears and thick necks and claws that resemble those of bears. Their bodies are completely covered in fur that may be brown, black, white, grey or even red, orange or tawny in color. A few tribes have stripes or collars of another fur color as a general rule, and other tribes consider such patterns a sign from their ancestors, whom they worship. They organize themselves into tight-knit family groups, usually between ten and thirty individuals.

When adulthood is reached, some ursine leave their tribe for on a spiritual quest of personal discovery. When they have finished, then return to their tribe and add their knowledge to the tribe, passing down their worldly wisdom to the next generation of cubs. These ursine spend up to fifteen years of their relatively short lives on such quests.

#### The Endless Journey
Ursine tribes are nomadic, and will pull their camps up and travel great distances with them to spend a season in a particular place with favored hunting or fishing grounds. Maintenance of tradition is important in ursine culture, and these places are often locations their family have returned to for generations.

Tribes often maintain formal diplomatic relations with the more populous races that inhabit their ancestral lands. Ensuring the tribe’s safety and security is of utmost importance, as is maintenance of sacred ancestral lands. Ursine tribes are known to fight or ally with their neighbors according to how they feel the land is being managed by the powers that be.

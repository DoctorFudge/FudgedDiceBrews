### Life on the Hoof
The moosefolk live primarily in the forests and upon the tundras of sub-temperate climates.

Elkin children grow rapidly, reaching adulthood in just a few years. Men and women alike have antlers on their heads, which vary from tribe to tribe and might resemble a deer or moose. They are tall and lean, and their short life cycles make parenting and reading their young in the traditions of their kind a top priority for any elkin tribe. Each winter, elkin shed their antlers and grow a new pair the following spring. In autumn, the rites of adulthood are performed for those who have come of age, where young and old compete with one another in great wrestling public matches of hoof and horn where the tribe’s grievances are aired and resolved in ritual combat if necessary.

Elkin are cautious, and use their innate magical abilities both to find food and to avoid predators and enemies. It is not uncommon to travel their lands and never see an elkin should they choose to avoid you. Most elkin tribes despise the shash tribe of the ursine, and consider them pests to be expelled from their lands.

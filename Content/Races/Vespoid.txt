Vespoids are the mightiest force in the Royal Hexagon, their queens ruling over vast territories and many bugs pledge their loyalty to them. Vespoids are hardworking and loyal individuals. They are formidable worker and the best of them take up high positions in whatever field they are specialised in. The Warriors of the Vespoid - Soildiers are respected and feared, as they are well trained and would fight to the death to protect their queens.

### Regal Stripes
The common Vespoid resembles a bee, with translucent wings, yellow to orange and black stripes, slightly furred chitin and beautiful compound eyes. For most Insectoids, Vespoids are the epiphany of beauty and it is no wonder that even the lowliest Vespoid is treated as royalty. These radiant Insectoids stand up to 5 to 6 feet tall, while Bumbles even reach heights of 8 feet or more.

### Royal and Cultured
The Royal Hexagon is one of the most powerful empires in Insectopia. Here six Vespoid queens rule from the safety of their giant trees and guide the world in the direction they see fit. Their Vespoid armies are the strongest and biggest over all, and Royal Hexagon soldiers are respected by their allies and feared by their enemies. They are highly trained and educated and they'll make sure you know about how much better they are than you. One of the biggest flaws of the Vespoids is their hubris and vanity, as they are raised with the mindset of being better than most of the other races.

### Metropolises High Above
Vespoid Hivecities are found in the crowns of giant trees, hanging from branches, build from special kinds of wax. Only Vespoids and ambassadors of other kingdoms are allowed access to the Hivecities, since Vespoids won't let common folk into their sanctums. From their high position they send out their armies and leaders to rule over the cities they conquered on the ground.

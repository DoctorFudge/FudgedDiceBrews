## Au Ra
[**Source:** *Final Fantasy XIV D&D Compendium*](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LsDqsNbupzeLhkTIcPv)

*We Xaela are nomads who roam and live off the land. My tribe was no different. Yet though we did no harm to those whose lands we traversed, they treated us as vermin. In their ignorance, they feared us, and that fear manifested as spite and violence.*

*My loved ones and I were cursed at, spat upon, beaten, and worse. It was out of the desire to protect them that I began my research.*

-Alaqa the Witch

The Au Ra are a misunderstood people due to their physical appearance. Their scaled bodies and horns led many to fear them, believing them to be descendants of dragons or demons. This fear led to hate, which gave way to violence, leaving these proud people fewer in number across much of the world. These conditions have led the Au Ra to value their families beyond all else.

### Variable Size
Au Ra are characterized by their curved horns and intricate patterning of scales across their bodies. Sleek and powerful tails extend out from behind the Au Ra. There is a striking difference in height between the males and females of the race, the men ranging from just over 6 feet tall to 7 and a half feet tall, while the women are dwarfed, rarely coming close to 6 feet tall. Their faces contain sharp features and piercing eyes, alluding to their normally serious and sullen demeanor.

Au Ra tend to dress very modestly, wearing simple robes and lengths of cloth draped over their bodies as cloaks, especially amongst the nomadic Xaela tribe. 

### Divided By Blood
The Auri creation myth tells the tale of two beings, the dawn father and the dusk mother. The two kinds of Au Ra have beliefs about their connection to these beings. The dark scaled Xaela are a nomadic people who believe that the blood of the dusk mother courses through their veins.

The Xaela view themselves as free spirit folk, who roam the lands hunting, gathering, and battling against other roaming tribes, in honour of their ancestors. The light scaled Raen have instead decided to assimilate into Eastern society, though they are a minority, their loyalty and service has been a great boon to the culture they've ingrained themselves in.

### Peaks, Valleys and Plains
The Au Ra's homeland is known as Othard, a region to the far east. A majority of their homeland is covered by sprawling plains known as the Azim Steppe which dominates the region. The Xaela clans travel across this sea of grasslands in close knit tribes. The northern and western reaches of Othard are shielded with high mountain peaks and deep valleys shrouded in mist. It is from these mists that the Raen originally hailed. Today most live in civilized society or hidden villages allowing them to live peaceful lives.

### For my family
An Au Ra may set off on an adventure for any number of reasons, a thirst of adventure, defense of their tribe or a mission for a master could send them on their path. This could go as far as searching for lost family members, or seeking revenge for a slight against their family.

It was consideration for their families which helped define the two bloodlines of the Au Ra. The Xaela sought to keep their traditional ways and use power to protect their families. The Raen felt that a peaceful livelihood amongst the other races of the world was the best approach to protect their community.

### Au Ra Names
The Au Ra approach names in two strikingly different ways. The Xaela see many names shared across tribes, but there are as many spellings for the same name as there are tribes. Xaela take the name of their tribe as their surname. The Raen name themselves in their tongue in a way that their name carries meaning. Only those belonging to the ruling and warrior class of society legally have surnames, while commoners may take a surname, it is not legally recognized. Raen who are in power often take surnames related to their feats in battle, while commoners take names related to their profession.

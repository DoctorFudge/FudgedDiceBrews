### Conjuring A Friend
Once upon a time in a far away kingdom, there lived a noble King, his beloved Queen and their lovely daughter the Princess. During the Princess's birthday they were sent a gift from the country's rival kingdom as a peace offering, but this was a sinister ruse. When the Princess opened the present a fowl darkness escaped from the box and enveloped the Queen reducing her to bone before her family's eyes.

While the King prepared to retaliate against his enemies, he still feared for his daughter's sanity after the horrid sight she witnessed and thus commissioned the Mage's Guild to find a way to safeguard his daughter. Feeling pity for the girl and her father the Mage's began to set work to crafting a lovely doll to comfort the Princess, however one of the mages had an epiphany and asked if they may tinker with the doll to test a conjuration ritual. There may be a way to not only appease the King's request, but bring a smile to the Princess who desperately needed warmth in her life.

The next day the Mage's Guild presented a gift to the King and the Princess, a lovely and silken box dressed in ribbons and decorated in arcane stars. When the box was opened, the Princess's eyes watered and a smile spread across her face, she embraced the mages gift for they gave her the greatest gift of all; her mother returned from the grave. The King's expression soured and demanded an explanation, and mages with the purest of intentions explained that the creature is her new bodyguard, a golem soft as cloth but strong as steel. A doll built to protect and serve the royal family in unwavering loyalty until death. The King frowned at the creature imposing as his beloved, but he dare not rip away his daughter's happiness. There was a war to be won...

### Too Old For Dolls
The Thrro are constructs made entirely of cloth, through a ritual of conjuration magic placed deep within the body of the golem, it is given life and told its purpose for living. The golem will follow its purpose without question, but the race was not build without empathy, it's design was to bring comfort but also to act as a guardian for those who commissioned for such a creature. The mage's began constructing more of the golems altering their physical appearances and their attributes with the arcane components now dubbed "Conduit Cloth", a fabric that surges with arcane possibilities. As the Thrro were manufactured and altered, they slowly became the perfect applicants for testing magic and performing manual labor for the Mages Guild. Even the act of the construction of a Thrro was used as a way to discover arcane aptitude for initiates of the guild.

As Thrro perform their appointed tasks they slowly absorb the world around them. They will form emotions, strengthen bonding ties with others, obtain a child like curiosity and even want and desire a future of their own. But even with their growing humanity they still follow and complete their task. Some Thrro who have completed their tasks will grow impatient and even become inert if not given a duty, their growing sense of humanity will spark them to form a life like the master's they serve. Thrro cannot reproduce as most other living beings, however they can create another Thrro body and with the joining of two Thrro's own conduit cloth within the new shell. This will give life to the shell and it will see the Thrro as their parents, creating a kinship and family but a Thrro must always have a task and see their duties completed with efficacy and loyalty.

### More Than Sentimental Value
Conduit Cloth is drenched in arcane conjuration energies, the arcane Weave within the cloth keeping a Thrro's body sturdy, strong and resilient to most physical damage. Should a Thrro's insides be exposed to the elements the arcane energies within them would vanish and seep into the environment making them wild magical time bombs waiting to happen should their life forces be depleted. So long as a Thrro's conduit cloth remains within them and maintain their physical body's properly, they could effectively live forever. Any lost conduit cloth within their bodies would regenerate over time just as human hearts regain lost blood.

Thrro are build with purpose and sometimes that purpose is to serve in wars, safeguard a person of interest, or to bring joy to the joyless. Without given purpose Thrro will venture off into the world to find their own. Often times this leads them to finding multiple masters in their lifetime, joining a cloister of a deity, or even serving a company of adventurers. Their physical bodies can be crafted to suit any given situation and the magic that keeps them alive makes them numb to pain and physical trauma, this makes them sought out by adventuring guilds to aid them in all sorts of quests. As long as there is a task that needs being performed a Thrro will offer its service for as long as it's body remains in tact.
